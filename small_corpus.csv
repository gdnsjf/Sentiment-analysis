I started playing Rock Band drums when the second one came out and my wife got burnt out on them.  There were several issues with the Rock Band 2 drums that made me desire this product.  The pads eventually started bubbling up (red and yellow at first) and the pedals broke all the time.  I have a Rock Band 2 set that is covered in duct tape and it still performs decently.  When Rock Band 3 came out, that was it.  I had to have this product.  I recently graduated from college and my wife told me i could get whatever I wanted.  After a month of thinking, I decided on this product.  First of all, Amazon shipping is super fast.  I got my product very quickly.  As soon as this thing came in the mail, I had ripped open the box only to find many smaller boxes inside.  My wife and I took out all the smaller boxes and examined all the components.  I was super excited to see that all the parts looked like they were high quality.  This set is massive, as mentioned in the other reviews.  Also, it is very heavy and does take about 45 minutes to an hour to set up.  After that, you will spend a great deal of time adjusting until you can hit the actual pads/cymbals and not completely miss and throw your drumsticks across the room.  Let me just say that, for a few days, this kit was AMAZING.  It was really the most fun I had ever had with Rock Band.  I felt like I was playing real drums!  I would wake up early just to play with this kit.  The problems started a few days in.  My wife had went to work and I had the entire day to spend with this kit.  After about 1 hour of playing, I noticed that I was missing notes that I shouldn't have been missing.  After some testing, I realized that the red pad would trigger all by itself...for seeming no reason.  I noticed that there was a LOT of static buildup on the pads.  They felt like a CRT TV when you put your hand up to it.  Once I noticed this, the ION brain had taken some minor damage from the static traveling to it and it started to perform poorly.  The whole issue with this kit (after researching) is that the pedal is made of solid metal and is connected directly to the brain.  The kit is NOT properly shielded from electricity.  I contacted amazon and they overnighted me a new kit.  I was greatly disappointed with my toy at this time but hoped that it was a fluke.  I saw so many videos on the internet of people playing this on carpet with seeming no problems.  I did not understand why I could not do the same.  I will say that it took me forever to package this thing back up.  It really felt like I was playing Tetris trying to get all this stuff back in the box.  Also, there was a slight sting I felt from wanting this product for so long and then immediately being disappointed by it.  Once the new one came, I took my time noting the position of all the boxes.  I did not want to have the same problem packaging it back up.  After putting the new one together.  It had even more problems.  The cymbals were double hitting and the red AND yellow pad would trigger for no reason.  At this point, I sent both of them back and got a refund.  Thank you Amazon for being so awesome.  I am very happy that I got my money back.  Most of the people on the internet were instead suckered by ION's awful support.  I read a common trick of theirs was to have you send back a portion of the kit that was deemed defective.  I read that it was very common for it to take up to 6 months(!) for the person to receive a new part.  This made the kit unreturnable because it was outside of Amazon's return period.  Do not get trapped like a lot of the people on the internet did.  Do not buy this product.  If you have just recently purchased it and are having problems.  Send it back.  It won't get better.  ION's support will not help you.  Just send it back and heavily modify your Rock Band 2 or Rock Band 3 kit and you will have just as much fun without the pain of this awful kit.  I wish everyone the best of luck.",Do Not Buy,1307232000,,,

But to use an analogy - A beautiful woman with a poor personality, makes for a lousy date.  This Star Wars games is very beautiful, but poor personality.  FLAW: This game is just too hard.  Remember the Star Wars scene where Luke loops rope around Walkers?  It's in the game, but insanely difficult.  It took me about 30 attempts.  Not fun.

Nuts.  6 hours later & about 100 attempts, I just barely beat it with about 1% life left.  It was frustrating, NOT fun.  Now I'm on some planet where I get killed off in about 3 minutes.  I've repeated this level another 50 times already, and I made some progress, but I'm not enjoying the time wasted.  Isn't that what gaming's about?  FUN?  Well, this ain't.

UBI Soft as a ""feature"" on their PC software that prevents installation from any drive with write capacity.  Why they feel that's a valid anti-piracy measure, and why they don't mind blowing off an entire segment of the market, is entirely beyond me, but that's not the point here.  Call UBI Soft tech support BEFORE buying this or any other PC game from them, and check to make sure whether or not you will be able to install.  Software (such as Chessmaster 9000) doesn't come with a warning on the box (in ""some"" cases, they claim -- I haven't found a single box that does), nor is there a warning on the Amazon product pages (short of reviews like this).  One could speculate that they're perfectly happy to let people buy their software knowing some won't be able to install it, but I'll leave their motivation to give no warning to consumers to your imagination.
UBI Soft's tech support has said that this ""feature"" extends to *all* of their PC titles.  So fair warning, particularly to folks with laptops where DVD/CDRW drives came standard, ask before you buy.  Perhaps if enough people have a problem with this flawed policy, UBI will smarten up.  ""Flawed"" because limiting installs to drives without write capacity isn't going to slow a determined game cracker/pirate down, it's only going to prevent normal consumers from being able to install the game.  Worse, they don't find out until they've opened the package and tried to install, which in some cases is enough to prevent a return and refund from the seller.

This was the first driving game released for PS4 because if it was released after any of the other driving games there would not have been enough sales to cover the costs to create this game, which is funny because it seems to be a very low budget game.

In my 30+ years of gaming I have never seen such a game-to-console mismatch.
Near all trailers are ""cut"" scenes and not actual game play.

The black bars top and bottom (letterbox) are annoying, but it doesn't matter what size your TV is, the graphics are so generic that the game is distorted and highly pixelated (I'm playing on a 55"" 240Hz TV).  The definition is simply not there, the game is ""lifeless"".  This factor alone ruins any chance of it bring you into its world.

Besides the cut scenes:
The character does not run with the landscape. His legs move as if they were an overlay.
The character's mouth moves completely unsynchronized, as they did 10+ years ago.
The head movement controls are a clunky ""box"" type; North, South, East, West.
At no point was my mind captivated by the game, I never felt I was the character.
Peripheral vision in the game was nearly nonexistent.

Sure, terran  marines give u a little laugh now and then but the controls are  frustrating. You have to right click(why not the usual left-click?) to  select units and you cant deselect them.

1.  An internet connection is required.  (no mention of that in the product discription or from Amazon.com's discription.)
2.  No minimal requirments are listed.  (no mention of that in the product discription or from Amazon.com's discription.)  I don't really hold it against Amazon--it's not really their job to open up/test/evaluate each product.
3.  After I finally got it installed (and it wouldn't run) then installed Steam (and IT wouldn't run or allow the program to run--I assume because it 'has' to be updated--I am now in the process of updating the game/steam.  I have been updating it for over an hour.  It took 45 mins. for the indicator to show 1% had been downloaded.  In other words I probably 'have to have' broadband.
4.  I don't have broadband.  (no mention of broadband was mentioned in the manufacturer's discription or Amazon's)...and my 5.6K dialup will disconnect in another three hours automatically.  Unless I can pick up the download where it is left off...I am screwed/toasted/robbed/doomed/.

I'm sure everybody who is pro 'F.E.A.R' are gonna say  '...just rate the game oldtechno!...'  I understand, and usually agree...but not this time.

1.  I paid for this, it's my judgement call to make.
2.  The manufacture knows the game requires an internet connection.
3.  (If I'm right about the slow connection) the manufacturer knows you need broadband to download the steam update/s.
4.  You can't play the game without steam installed that first time to activate (the game so it will run--as far as I can tell).  And as far as I know, I can't install the game without steam.
5.  Therefore, steam and the program, count as the same program. (it is on the same disk yeaknow.)

Bottomline;
1.  If you don't have an internet connection;
2.  If you don't have broadband;
3.  If your system doesn't meet the below listed requirments;...

...pass this one by.

MINIMUM SYSTEM REQUIRMENTS;
CPU; P4 2.8GHZ (3.2GHz Vista) Athlon 64 3000+ (3200+ Vista)
GPU;  Fully DX9-compliant Graphics card with 256MB (SM 2.0b); NVIDIA GeForce3 6800 or ATI X700.
MEMORY;  1GB (1.5GB Vista)
HDD;  12GB
OS;  Windows XP SP3/Vista SP1.
DIRECTX;  9.0c 2008 November
SOUND;  DX9.0c complaint
OPTICAL DRIVE;  DVD (boxed only)
INTERNET;  (I just now read this)...Broadband!

So there it is--I've been screwed...again.

I want all of you reading this to remember...the industry knows they are doing this to us...but they want a bigger piece of money for their work.  Well...oldtechno is tired of being robbed.  Henseforth, no matter how good the game, if they don't list the minimum requirments/whether or not an internet/broadband connection is needed--they will get no more than one star and THAT's if I was silly enough to buy it in the first place.

I suggest all of you do the same...then you can tell about the game...afterall, it might have been you.  Now, if you all will excuse me, I've got to disconnect and try to install the 'Orange Box' games...I believe they use steam to...and probably that same broadband connect I didn't know about until just now.

1. the maps are garbage and everything is ridiculously fast paced, just like COD. I paid for battlefield, not COD.
2. The vehicles are complete trash. I'm mainly referring to the ground based vehicles. It's literally unbearable to drive any of them. The cars from ""true crimes:Streets of LA"" have better handling then this game.
3. There's no variety of weapons. This is a huge issue in my opinion.
4. The  graphics are lagging.

Battlefield should have never went the ""cops and robbers"" route. I mean, it's fricken ""Battlefield"" not ""a life on the beat"". I honestly plan on destroying the disc i have and totally regret buying this game. I'll buy another battlefield once it's about the military again. and if it's a new Bad Company Battlefield game, I'll actually pre order it. I miss flying jets, driving in tanks...vehicles that aren't moronic.

I'd give this one stars, but i do follow battlefield on facebook and the staff reply to most of the hate mail they receive...i think it's mainly because they know it's complete trash and now have to deal with it. So yeah, i guess their customer service is worthy of me bringing
 it up to two stars.

Update: I did actually break this disc in half. I played it at a buddy of mines recently and it's still a terrible game..somehow worse actually. I reduced this to one stars for a few reasons:
- they price dropped this game from $60-$39 quicker than any game I've ever seen, demonstrating desperation and the need to sell before all potential buyers get wind of how terrible this game is.
- the customer service I spoke of on their Facebook page isn't actialky that great. They'll reply with ""oh tell us how this game sucks"" and once you give a legit reason, they don't reply. If you say you like it however, they reply.
- I've never seen so many fake 5 star reviews for a game. It's really despicable how EA is that desperate for this game to not show its true rating from actual people. EA, stop manipulating votes, your game is trash.

I have to say for a transformation type of game they did not bother to have your character ""power up"" when the transformation is done. seems to be more a visual pleaser then anything involved with gameplay. the environments are very very bland and have few textures. the lighting and particle effects are low end and lame at best. what could have been a solid pirate game is now nothing more then a low budget platformer dressed up as a pirate *perhaps stealing your money?* truly a letdown in the pirate catagory.

UBI Soft as a ""feature"" on their PC software that prevents installation from any drive with write capacity.  Why they feel that will slow down a game cracker, and why they don't mind blowing off an entire segment of the market, is entirely beyond me, but that's not the point here.  Call UBI Soft tech support BEFORE buying this or any other PC game from them, and check to make sure whether or not you will be able to install.  Software (such as Chessmaster 9000, just to grab a random example) doesn't come with a warning on the box (in ""some"" cases, they claim -- I haven't found a single box that does), nor is there a warning on the Amazon product pages (short of reviews like this).  One could speculate that they're perfectly happy to let people buy their software knowing some won't be able to install it, but I'll leave their motivation to give no warning to consumers to your imagination.
UBI Soft's tech support has said that this ""feature"" extends to *all* of their PC titles.  So fair warning, particularly to folks with laptops where DVD/CDRW drives came standard, ask before you buy.  Perhaps if enough people have a problem with this flawed policy, UBI will smarten up.  ""Flawed"" because limiting installs to drives without write capacity isn't going to slow a determined game cracker/pirate down, it's only going to prevent normal consumers from being able to install the game.  Worse, they don't find out until they've opened the package and tried to install, which in some cases is enough to prevent a return and refund from the seller.

""I cannot begin to tell you how excited I was for this game and how utterly devastated I am at the final result!!!!!

There are no cutscenes, no beginning, no emotional attachment to the characters or environment!!! If you don't watch Kingsglaive you have no clue what is going on.

The story is non-existent and in a final fantasy game that is unacceptable and unheard off. Final fantasy lives and breathes the plot and story firstly so for me this was not a final fantasy game.

Also, I cannot believe how much was cut from the original versus game!! The scenes with Noctis at the beginning coming down the stairs to fight the imperial troops with the sword shield and climbing the building to kill the troops was the cornerstone of the game and so emotional it was the best thing I had ever seen and I fully expected to see this in the final game! Why would you cut all the cutscenes out of the game and put them in a movie?? This is utterly pointless as the game becomes a hollow shell with just a massive expansive open world to explore.

 Also, the leviathan fight was NOTHING like the original trailers and was totally simplified and looked crap! Shamefully, SE had multiple story driven CGI game trailers they released to the public AND NONE OF THESE SCENES APPEAR IN THE GAME! This is misleading and can lead to legal action against the company for misrepresentation of the final product such as the same kind of result as watch dogs or Destiny.

One thing I cannot believe is that in the in game menu there isn't even a bestiary or story index which blows my mind? How can you have a final fantasy game without these things?

Also magic is so poor, ONLY FIRE, ICE AND LIGHTNING??? WTF??? Come on what about Ultima, Holy, tornado, meteor, cure/cura/curaga, shell, protect, regen, bio, stone, break, flare etc!!!!

Also the summons are so few and incongruous; the point of a summon in final fantasy is to have control and give your all to summon the aid of a god not have to run round a map and wait to see if they will show up and only in specific areas! Also they won't show up in an epic boss battle but will for a run of the mill fight on the world map, this doesn't seem right. You cannot level them up either which was the main part of having them to get stronger and learn new powers etc. Also you obtain Bahamut and Ifrit but cannot use them?? Bahamut only shows up in a boss fight this is so wrong!!!

There are only 4 party members and you can never control the other three and they have such a lack of party customisation. You cannot even programme the party on the basics of their actions like fight, protect, use items/magic etc.

I could go on and on as I am so upset with this game! Final Fantasy is a living breathing entity which is based on these fundamentals which cannot be changed otherwise the end product ISN'T a final fantasy game but becomes something else with a final fantasy sticker slapped on the side of it. True fans of the original series will never accept anything less than this!!!!!

I only hope and pray that SE do the final fantasy 7 remake justice - The STORY is the most important part of that game and it NEEDS CGI cutscenes to link emotion and story telling the same was as the original. If they focus primarily on combat etc like FF15 the whole project will be a flop!!!. That remake is for the FANS NOT NEWCOMERS.

Bottom line - DONT CHANGE A WINNING FORMULA AND BETRAY THE MILLIONS OF ORIGINAL FANS WHO HAVE PLAYED FF FOR 20 YEARS AND SPIT IN THEIR FACES!!!!

Wait ... beyond junk.  It's bizzare in how bad it is.  The controls are so bad I actually hurt myself.  The graphics are cheap and crappy.  The on screen instructions are even worse than the game play.  The interface was confusing.

Only two games are slightly playable, skeet ball and ring toss.  My son, who is 7, did enjoy these two for about 5 minutes only because it was a game we could play together but I highly doubt he will ever want to play it again because the graphics are so bad.  Instead we will go back to Wii Sports bowling and Wii Play fishing.

The volley ball game is UNPLAYABLE, very complex and just bizzare.  Just try serving, go ahead try it! Then try hitting the ball after serving, button A+upswing to set, button B+down swing to hit, shake the control like crazy to do a super spike.  Now do this all in about 2 seconds.  No? couldn't do it?  We gave up on this game mid-way.  So back to Wii Sports Tennis.

And how about that kayacking?  Can you even tell what is meant by the Wii remote icon over all 4 players, even though two players are CPU players.  And occassionally the Wii remote icons will turn into a Red X, even over the CPU players.  I guess those CPU players' Wii remote lost their signal. Back to ANY Wii racing game I ever played (Wii Play cow race, Wii-ware racing games)

Oh and what was it with multi player mode?  You pick multiplayer and you are shown 4 boxes with two Wii remote icons in each with no explaination.  Ya that makes PERFECT sense to me.

The controls are so horrible and unresponsive, this lack of response will make you swing, flick harder and harder.  This caused my arms to hurth.  No really hurt.  All the crazy movements I do with Wii Sports boxing, or Wii Fit boxing NEVER hurt my arm.  Yet M&M volleyball hurht my arm like a Little League pitcher who threw too much during a season.

This game did do one good thing, it made me appreciate all the great Nintendo titles suchs as Sports, Fit, Sports Resort, Mario Super Sluggers.  I longed for those games as my wrist and armed hurt from over flicking.

I wish there was such a thing as a no star rating because I would have given that.  We did get it for free as someone else was going to donate it to Salvation Army.  I may help this game continue it's journey to Salvation Army, however this posses a moral delima to me.  Can I, a fan of video games, contribute to the life span of this bizzarely horrible game?

I just imagine the look of excitement on a child's face as she sees this game waiting for her, only for her to realize she's been ripped off.

PC gamers put CoD on the map and they turn around and spit in our faces. I'm embarrassed that I spent my hard earned dollars on this turd and am really kicking myself for not checking the reviews here first.
The Pros:
Amazing Graphics, really polished visuals with varied and beautiful locales.
Gritty, adult oriented story and missions.
Very intense single player battles
The Cons:
I bought this at 8pm last night and I just beat it. It's 10am now and yes, I got a full night's sleep between then and now.
Multiplayer is some kiddy console matchmaker system that doesn't make use of servers.
9v9 max for multiplayer. No epic battles here.
No servers means no huge battles, no custom maps, no mods, to sum it up: NO RE-PLAYABILITY.
Steam. I'm not in the ""Steam=SecuROM"" camp but I still think it sucks. I've found it to be buggy and unreliable and I resent being forced to use it to play a supposed A-list game.
The single player campaign is fun despite being so short. I'll probably play through it once more today, maybe spend a day or two on the wimpy and dull multiplayer, then put this game on the shelf and dream of what else I could have spent my money on. Tomorrow or the next day, after I uninstall it (along with that stupid Steam program) I'll play a World at War custom map on a server with 31 other frag happy gamers.
Conclusion:
Wait until this hits the bargain bin. This game is more of an expansion than a full release. The single player campaign is worth maybe $20-$30 while the multiplayer is an affront to all things PC gamers hold dear. Seriously, if I wanted to play an Xbox game I would buy an Xbox.

After playing Civ V in offline mode I can say that it is not worth [...]. Once you get to $[...], you're hitting the mark. I mean $[...] for a platinum plus ""All civilization V addons and DLC"" version.

What is there good to say about it? Well, there are a lot of units you'll recognize and the gameplay mechanics are mostly familiar, albeit grossly simplified.

Now on to the rest.

The AI in singleplayer is disappointingly dimwitted. There is no diplomacy. Having 6 civilizations ( all of them in that game ) declare war then declare peace at the same time without being allied and without talking to me first was enough to make me slightly green.

The AI in multiplayer was ridiculous. I paid off two militaristic city states and sailed the spawned units overseas to camp on the AI's border. After about 12 units got there and the AI didn't communicate with me, my friend got bored and finally declared war on them. I had all of their cities in three turns. This was at a moderate difficulty level.

The quotation reader is, unfortunately, sort of boring. The quotes are too long ( they're 'good quotes' but you kind of want them out of your face after two seconds because they're boring. ) and the reader is slow.

People talk about the fancy ritzy new AI screens and how they're all voice acted in their native languages. That would be an AWESOME finishing touch if there were better AI, more civilizations, more ways to play outside of gold wh---hording and buying everything, better diplomacy, an option to automatically set workers to automated ( hey, you can ALWAYS buy one if a city starts starving, which coincidentally the AI workers are too dumb to prevent from happening or respond to. ).

Speaking of which, they actually can't connect trade routes reliably. I tell them to build a road somewhere, they can't do it...anyway, where was I?

Oh, right, the mugging I just endured from this company.

Anyway, as if this weren't bad enough, the entire game was buggier than a lice ridden monkey at launch. Though it was talented with memory dumps. The game crashed more than a drunk with epilepsy in a bumper car. Do you realize how much talent it takes to make software that buggy and get it to sell?

Anyway, the gameplay was hideous for the Civilization series. I'd expect this level of AI in a Risk board game knockoff, not the premiere turn based strategy game. They need to hire some AI specialists and let THEM do the coding.

To add insult to financial injury, this game is on steam, requires steam, needs steam, wants steam, will not leave steam, but will work in offline mode in LAN play allowing you to spread your steam account around and play offline. So Steam doesn't do anything but keep you from reselling the game. It's less effective than a simple CD-key check when the game connected for multiplayer would be.

Don't buy it.

It just doesn't exist. They'd rather make a game that cheats and looks stupid and unrealistic. I cannot begin to tell you how bad this game cheats...and how user-skill is completely thrown out the window....but I'll try.

The ""Legend"" skill level might be the most controlled piece of garbage I have ever played. You cannot control the accuracy of your pitches (they just move your pitch right into their hot zone)...you are not rewarded for guessing the right pitches and having perfect timing...and you constantly get screwed on phantom tags by the A.I. And one of my favorites is when you finally do make a perfect pitch, the A.I. crushes it anyway. It could be outside the strike zone all together but it will still fly out of the ballpark. Unreal.

People think this game is hard. It's not hard. It just cheats like crazy. The concept isn't hard....it's getting the game to reward you for having some skill that makes it difficult. It just doesn't. Why even give a person the controller? You cannot do a thing unless the A.I. lets you. Seems like everytime runners are on, the A.I. gets you to ground into a DP. I get a pitch up in the zone, press up on the right stick to force a fly ball....and yep, you guessed it, it STILL is a ground ball double play. NO USER SKILL. And the timing thing is a joke. I've had perfect timing and it still a weakly hit ball. NO USER SKILL.

I guess that's the way it is now. No matter how well you think you're playing, you'll still lose. I've been up 4 or 5 runs and the very next inning, I cannot locate a pitch, I cannot get the A.I. out and every hit of theirs is either in the gap or over the wall. Complete A.I. control. EA, 2K and now Sony....all run the same program. Cheat and control. Forget making it REALISTICALLY more difficult. Let's just glitch and control the game. It's the lazy way to make a sports game.

Greedyvision and IW basically screwed us all with the (purely monetary) decision to drop dedicated servers ($).  The game requires Steam ($) so no resales or trading.  The up front price is ridiculous ($) for any PC game, even a hotly-anticipated, outstanding title (which this one MIGHT have been).  No modding allowed ($) so they can charge for lots of (tiny) expansions.

All the ($) really killed this game.  It is of course easy to get a superior product through piracy, but that is typical these days. Pirated versions allow you to do what the game should have allowed.  The price gouging and crippled features will simply drive more people to find the pirated version, rather than preventing it.

It's doled out piecemeal, as you'd expect with a horror game, but the first 80% of the game has 20% of the story, while the last 20% (when you get to the underground site) has about 40% of the story squished into a small timeframe and area.  That's right - 40% + 20 % = 60%.  So where is the other 40%?  Apparently, hopefully, somewhere in the sequel.

I can see where many of the monsters based on the seven sins were given a modern treatment; it is certainly a well used inspiration for art, photography and the like.  If I were to design the game, I would have given it a more classic treatment, much like Gustav Dore'.  Nonetheless, the game has some interesting visual aspects, and to be clear, are very adult in nature.  This is no child's game.  It deals with Hell and all the deadly sins, and the vision of Hell with all of its trapped souls, mutilated, burned, crushed, and so on is certainly a vision to behold.  The visual aspect of the game I enjoyed.

Why do I not like this game?  Perhaps, I was expecting too much.  First of all, in my opinion, it is a total rip of God of War.  Game play is everything, and to be candid, there were no surprises.  After several levels, it began to become repetitive, and after dispatching the attacking minions of Hell, it all became too easy.  Once you figure out how to absolve or punish them, it all became too easy.  There is a lot of jumping and leaping around, and as the title of this review says, jumping again. Then came the puzzles, which required excruciating timing, and that aspect of it began to become extraordinarily boring.

I have been playing games since 1981, I even worked at ATARI circa 1982, I also teach Game Project Management, Game Design and Software Development at the college I teach at.  A message to all of the Game Designers out there:  making something intensely complex and extremely difficult which requires the ability to get your character to accomplish tasks in a specific order with microsecond timing IS NOT GAME PLAY; it is a clear indication to me that since you could not make game play more interesting, well, let's just make it difficult and painful in place of logic, level design, characterization.  A colleague of mine says that if a game is too difficult to play, we should get our money back.  I would love to see the Developers of this game try to get out of Purgatorio with their kind of game logic.  The game is also very short.  Dante's Inferno is rich in history, allegory, characterization, such incredible and truly horrific creatures, and we can finish the game all in a matter of ten hours?  Part of the issue of game play is, is it replayable?  Dante's work is the kind of literature that requires not just reading, but re-reading to fully understand what is going on.  What we get is a High School outline from this game, or dare I say a graphic novel treatment?  This is why I have come to hate it: from my point of view, Dante is given short shrift, and is more an exploitation than  exploration of his work.

Well, I got through it, but I cannot recommend it, and I can't ask for my money back.  However, I can save you the trouble.  For me, it is ALL about gameplay, story, characterization, logic, level design.  No matter how visually stunning a game (or movie for that matter) may be, it has to be interesting, challenging (but not painfully so).  (P.S. - I have the same problem with Avatar).

As part of the game, there is supposed to be some free downloadable content in March, but I won't be downloading it, and I won't be playing it.

That said, the game itself hasn't really aged well. The mechanics of the classes are derived from the quake days, and the limitations show.

Biggest example is the soldier. Now, the soldier relies heavily on a move called the ""rocket jump"" where you basically fire a rocket at your feet and then use the energy to fly in the air towards your enemy.

Without the rocket jump, the soldier is lousy.

However, the rocket jump is also very hard to get right. It also does damage to you. It relies on what amounts to a bug in the original quake's physics engine.

Other games have done it better. In particular, Firefall (a game that is still in beta) has the assault class which fires rockets just like the soldier. He has a rocket pack. And several movement boosting abilities. It works out quite well. ALso, the jetpack class in warhammer space marine does it better.

In the end, though, this game and this series as a whole was just a big waste of time for me. After devoting countless hours to the Mass Effect series (games, books, developer diaries, etc), being completely enveloped in the game's world and elaborate history, and giving this series more love than any other work of fiction I have ever come across, I've completely written off this game series and the developer (Bioware).

That said, developers certainly didn't put much thought at all into this game. I can't tell you how many times I peeked around a corner after clearing an area, turned around to check my 6:00 to then have one just appear out of nowhere right in front of me. And I'm not talking about a dead one that just got up either. Just poof, it was there. An annoying trend in this game that will frustrate you to death.
If they did this for the sole reason of having the zombies slowly whittle away at your health so you are always playing in a state of high stress they could have mapped it out better than just having them appear in front of you, but I certainly think it was just poor programming, or lazy programming, take your pick.

They charged way too much for the effort put into this title. 50$? I suppose it was to pay Reedus. Normans voice acting was about the best thing in this game.

The game is also way too damn short as others have said.

Graphics are fairly lame in comparison to other titles out today. With the poor graphics it makes me wonder why the loading times were a little long. The maps weren't that big, and apparently the drawing files weren't that big either. Again, laziness, or ineptitude. I can't abide either.

The string of busted and content lacking releases this year has finally got me, and this broken and bare version of Assetto Corsa is the worst offender. The day one patch is a slight improvement, but the amount of screen tearing is still not acceptable. I'm usually immune to some screen tear but this game has too much. Then there is the giant stutter whenever you contact another car, or a wall. So basically this game has to stop everything else that it's doing,calculate some damage or the effect of an impact, then resume racing when it's done. Never seen anything like it before.

The lack of content is also not acceptable. There's a Drift mode, a Career mode and a Special Events mode. The problem with the Career mode is that it contains the SAME EXACT races as the Special Events mode, only slightly remixed! Add to that the AI drivers running lap times that are either near or completely impossible to replicate, and you end up with what is a disappointing package. Don't forget the lack of a private lobby function for online play, which means forget running league races or grouping up with friends. Release date for private lobby is unknown, if ever.

Do not apply the PC reviews to the console game. It's obvious the PS4 version was developed as if the PC version did not exist.

They have long since been shut down, and have scattered to a variety of different studios (Runic Games, for example, creators of Torchlight 1, 2, and the upcoming MMO). Diablo 3 plays like it was made by people who did most of their work on World of Warcraft, and it really shows. I live in NYC, and the day 1 server launch was slated for 3 am Eastern time (Midnight on the West Coast). I was willing to stay up really late for what I expected to be an epic game, but I was surprised by the fact that their servers kept giving error messages instead of a successful login. This issue didn't go away until the next day.

Now about the game itself. The skill system, potion system, stat system, respawn system, and gear system have essentially been World-of-Warcraft-ized. You no longer have the joy of gradually building up your character by carefully spending skill points to level up specific skills. You no longer have the joy of selecting how you want to use your stat points in order to customize your stat build. The cool down on potions is an exact copy of how it works in World of Warcraft. This works fine for a slow-paced MMORPG, but it is completely out of place in a fast-paced Action RPG. The checkpoints for respawning are sometimes so clogged with enemies that you die immediately upon respawn, without even a chance to portal back to town. This sometimes has led to completely broken gear, and an inability to go to town to repair it without leaving the game and starting a new one.

The game balance is completely broken. Demon Hunters and Wizards essentially monopolized the Auction House. This is because they are the only classes that could farm Inferno difficulty Act 3 and 4 (for the best drops in the game) without spending tens of millions of gold on getting properly equipped first (on the Auction House). The rest of the classes are handicapped and at the mercy of the economy in this sense. Don't bother wasting your money on this heap of trash.

Developers said more than once in interviews that the planets are not the same and everything is procedurally generated. Played the game for more than 7 hours and visited more than 2 dozen planets. Well, guess what, the planets ( which is like 95% of the game content ) are actually the same, those may be different in color but the gameplay, layout and overall feeling is exactly the same. It doesn't matter if you see one or 1000, all planets feel the same. There is no depth in the gameplay whatsoever. While I understand developers didn't wanted to really tag the game as specific type of game and player should just find on its own what to do with the journey the actual experience is practically almost 0. Shooting rocks, or making wholes , collecting elements is all it is, repeatable grind non-stop. There nothing really curious or exciting . I feel totally cheated !!!

It's really not that good compared to what else is available, and the improved graphics and audio are the very least one should expect from a next gen console game.

When I received the item, opened the packaging, I realized that I couldn't get the case open. I attempted to apply all the force I could with my hands to get it open without outright breaking it.

So, I got out a metal flat head screw driver, applied a sizable amount of prying force and was able to get the case open.

The main issue is the screen protector. First off, if the screen isn't in its locked position, the case WILL NOT CLOSE without damaging your psp, so it must be locked. When it's locked, it's jammed and can't be opened without some sort of metal prying tool.

After prying it open the first time, I decided to give the case a second chance, placed my psp inside, locked the screen protector in place and closed the case.

You earn keys and scrap. You earn them VERY slowly. Keys give you a (very, VERY small) chance at a good gun. Scrap lets you buy a new gun. I am about to get to level 55 for the first time. I have made, at a guess enough scrap to buy 1 legendary weapon, if I had saved ALL of my scrap for that one gun. Epic is the best tier of weapon and costs 2 1/2 times a legendary. So... about a month to earn enough scrap to buy ONE legendary by playing the game, if you never buy anything else and play a LOT.

You get about 8 keys an hour playing. 30 keys to unlock a chest with a chance at a legendary or epic weapon. I have one of each. Unfortunately the legendary is only OK, the epic is a worthless shotgun (and I like shotguns) that uses your own health as ammo.

And it is unfair. Most of the epic guns are over-powered (e.g. NV4 - Flatline. Infinite damage range and reduces sway) and unless you are extremely lucky you will NEVER have that weapon. Certainly you will never have more than a few Epic guns.

Or you can pay real money to buy keys.

  --- battle you have to walk up to your target and hold down a key or the left mouse button (or super fast click).  If you knock your target out of your range, you have to use the keyboard to clunkily follow after it before you can hit again.  Half the time I can't tell if I'm actually making contact with my target even if I'm touching it.

 - Character creation: *This* is customizable?
  -- beginning creation is quick .. very quick.  You no longer even get to assign stat points.  You have 4 race choices, are down to a mere 3 class choices (rogue and warrior can choose between two specializations, and mage gets a subset physical attack later in the game).  I miss the BG days when I could be a half-whatever with three different class specializations, including a switch halfway through the game, if I didn't start out that way) and rolled my stats for hours (literally) with great pleasure to get the optimal - THAT was customization.
  --- When creating your character, beware.  What you see in the creation screen may not be what you get (Bioware has had this issue for eons, so at least I expected this)

 - Graphics glitches: really? (Edit: I have a high-end gaming machine and am running on ultra, though I've tried all levels)
  -- During character creation I moved my guy's ears up a bit and the hair style glitches *through* the tops of his ears, making him somewhat hobbit-like.  This doesn't go away in gameplay.  <sigh>
  -- My character's hair was created black.  In the opening cutscene it's black.  After the opening cutscene, it ranges from taupe to green and even turned yellow for a time
  -- My jacket stands out behind me like some kind of tail .. I think they were trying to convey wind?, but comes off as though someone's holding it up like a train.  Distracting and annoying.
  -- Clothing .. changes on its own - both style and color (this is most obvious and annoying in the very beginning
  before you start customizing your own gear
  -- *What* is up with all the shine?  I first thought I was wandering around on an ice slick, until I put togther winter ..errm.. this must really be ice.  And *everyone's hair (aside from changing colors - it's not just mine) is this shiny clumpy plastic reflective mess.  And the lips .. like mirrors.

I've been waiting for this game and I *want* to like it so badly.  I tried switching to a gamepad, but the whole point of getting it for my PC vs my PS4 was to play via mouse/kb - I *like* that sort of gaming, for my RPGs.  On top of that, the story is .. ok.  It's more than good enough, but when you have all the technical issues, it's not driving enough to keep me going.

After playing about 5 minutes horrendous gameplay, I soon felt that I was ripped off out of the money I paid to rent this garbage (thank goodness for rentals).  Here are some major downfalls of BW:
The character models are poor.
When characters talk, the mouths don't even move.
Computer AI is extremely cheap.
Computer has almost 99% perfect accuracy when picking up & throwing weapons from a distance at you, they almost never miss.
Create-Character-Mode is cheap beyond cheapness.

Especially creating characters.  The worst part of the game.  Fans of WWE Create-a-character modes will be woefully disappointed.  The player can't even create a character from scratch, all they can do is select a pre-made character and mobilize their stats and fighting style.  You can't even develope the character's costume.  All you do is choose a costume that has already been made (imagine playing a fighting game as your favorite character and choosing a different costume for them to fight in, that's technically all you can do).  There aren't even many move to choose from for your character.  Yes the game does have it's strong points such as taking full advantage of the X-box's custom soundtracks system, and there are some nice videos to watch in the media room (some of which have to be unlocked).  However, is it really worth playing through, just for videos?  What's worst is that the game doesn't even play like a wrestling game.  It plays more so of that as a button-mashing fightng game.

Rather than having each individual computer opponent actually race, as they might in real life, their speed is tied directly to your speed. If you slow down, they slow down. If you speed up, they speed up. In theory, this keeps races close, and exciting.
In Sled Storm, it makes them obnoxiously difficult, and takes any semblance of ""fun"" out of racing. It takes the ""race"" out of racing, in fact. You can hit every shortcut, every turbo boost, and not make a single mistake throughout the entireity of a 10 minute long race, and if you make a minor mistake at the end, you can go from 1st place to 6th in less than half a second, with no way to recover. This isn't an issue of making a huge mistake, and falling behind, it's an issue that no matter how well you know a track, and can exploit it, you'll *never* get more than half a second ahead of last place.
As a result, Sled Storm isn't a racing game, it's a game about not making any mistakes, ever. It's not fun, it's not interesting, it's a horrible way to have implemented the computer ""AI"", and it makes the game so utterly pointless and worthless that it's not likely I will ever play it again.","The worst computer ""AI"" in any racing game, ever.",1034726400,22,,

I configured the Windows audio to use the USB for communications and the Optical for sound. The instructions are pretty vague but it isn't too difficult to figure out.

I charged the headset fully. Then I put them on to try them out and to my horror there was a constant buzz in the right channel. Not a blow my ears out buzz but a nice low annoying buzz like electronic interference generated by computer equipment if you know what I mean. It didn't change frequency often but does alternate once in a while between two different pitches. It persisted in the background and was audible through music and sounds during quieter spots.

I tried disconnecting from my PC thinking it was the source but it still persisted. I tried putting a ferrite core on the USB cable and it didn't help. Even when I power the base off and plugged my cell phone directly into the headset with the included cable it persisted.

I normally use a set of Corsair Vengeance 2000 wireless headphones on my PC and a set of Ultimate Ears TripleFi 10 earphones everywhere else.

In my testing I found the sound to be average at best. The bass was there but the mids and highs sounded off to me. Especially the highs sounding harsh to me. I even think the Turtle Beach PX4 wireless headphones sounded better than these and I wasn't too crazy about those either.

Nothing else I could say about this headset really matters with the constant buzzing problem. It is unacceptable to me. I did a search for afterglow buzzing and found lots of hits for PDP headphones, this and other models. Maybe I got a bad set but with the number of hits I got in my search I question the quality control or maybe even the overall design. I am not sure what is causing the buzz but I know that none of the other wired or wireless speakers and headsets that I have exhibited a buzz like this. It isn't too often that I dislike a product enough to give it one star but this one just rubs me the wrong way. Even if it didn't buzz I don't think that I'd like it that much due to the way it sounds to me.

Wait until they put out a couple of patches (IF they do) before purchasing this game. It seems like it would be fun. Too bad.

Dec 22nd, 2009 - More than 3 months after the game was released, they finally patched it. The following patch notes are from the game's official forums:

Fixes:

  * 5.1 Surround Sound was not working properly for some users.
  * Several crashes for users running ATI cards have been fixed (most often when accessing Display Options in game)
  * Performance improved on ATI cards
  * Cursor Sensitivity for 360 controller has been tweaked. Before, moving diagonal and vertical adjustments moved at different speeds. They now move at equal speeds.
  * Turret Sensitivity has been adjusted to work without having to drop the base value.
  * MP Playlists will be updated to include all maps and modify certain options. Currently, a few maps are only available through Custom Matches.
  * Some overlapping text and icons have been fixed.
  * (9/30) Modding will be disabled in online matchmaking games with this patch. It will still be available in LAN games, though no XP will be awarded there.

So I finally got to spend a couple of hours today playing a game I purchased over 3 months ago. I'm not terribly impressed. The game is Grand Theft Auto Destroy Everything, which in theory sounds fun, but the implementation is dismal. Vehicle control with an XBox 360 controller or keyboard/mouse is extremely inaccurate. Driving in general feels like a chore. Blowing stuff up is fun, but the missions range from ridiculously easy to next to impossible. The last mission in the first area was designed by a full blown moron. Up to 30 enemy trucks drive around the screen, smashing into each other at random in an attempt to stop you from completing the mission. With so many enemies, and the complete lack of control you have over your vehicle, it is next to impossible to complete the mission. Only trying over and over and finally getting lucky one time did I complete this mission, ON EASY!

1) Software is crazy laggy, won't change sensitivity after their tool is installed. After computer restarts sensitivity drops back to maximum. Very very stupid not finished software, not ready for the market at all. What a big shame.
In fact was working better without their software. Software itself is so ugly, looks like it's from 90s.
2) right button annoyingly squeaks - what a surprise at this price point.
3) Mouse drops connection every once in a while
4) battery dies like crazy, dies overnight on IDLE if you don't put it to charge - crazy isn't it? And they used NiMH battery btw. Why?
5) Overall ergonomic design is a total fail, feels really bad in a palm, and way too flat for human hand. height adjustment has no practical point, another bell for kids. Changes almost nothing.
6) Side buttons - designed by octopus and FOR OCTOPUS. if you find these buttons actually usable and comfortable, my congratulations - you are an Octopus! :) Not very funny though to see it on $136 mouse in a fancy cube box.

The charger (internal) cannot seem to utilize the battery very well and runs out of life very fast!  I spent more time with it plugged in charging vs. wireless... it seems to have some very high energy threshold such that if batter drops even to 1.35V it seems to fail completely.  So I recharge the rechargeable batteries again, after day use, back to red, repeat over and over.  My MX mouse could go over a week without even having to be hooked up and then I could still use it while hooked up to wire - not this one - it says you need to take off extension and plug directly in to charge - I cannot do that since computer it 6' away.  And it did not come with software to load drivers, so windows 7 for some reason kept thinking it was a standard mouse even after downloading drivers - I spent hours trying to get this right in windows (plug and pray more like it).  Then the software itself was poorly designed...  it should be simple right....
Do you want to create a new profile for mouse - click yes?
Select button assignments and then click save (not so easy)
Then pick profile name to save under - very straightforward - but not so much so with this software.
I think any smart HS student could have come up with an easier way to create your profile (including using game files).  Really poor design!!
What is the deal with Logitech support anymore - they really need to fix their pages - you go to main pages where you can choose support, then picture of mouse (sound easy right), then it is empty!  They obviously do not support that path - later you find another path and there are the drivers - very poor setup- once again , a HS student could set this up more user friendly.  As a key player in this market there really is no excuse to have such a poor structure to their website - there is software to check this (validate links paths are correct).

I will buy their G600 instead, that claims a long battery life of 250 hours - heck I would love to get even 30!

The buttons are easily mapped and stick is stiff, but responsive. Perfect for PVP.  My gripe though seems to be a common one after doing a lot of homework on way my ship was constantly rolling to the left. The twist function within the joystick doesn't seem to be durable as I've had to set up a return order.  Now this is where I really am annoyed.

Logitech, one of the largest accessory companies has been absolutely horrible about the claim I filed.  I've been waiting days on end for a response and was forced to go go back to amazon.com to see what they'd suggest.  To my surprise, Amazon went and ok'd the return due to the manufacturer not being supportive.  Big Kudos to Amazon.

Overall: maybe I just got a bad joy..  I really like the stick during the first few months of ownership. It's comfortable and ofters a wide variety of buttons that's convenient for your casual flyer. I've seen other sticks with separate throttle and buttons on this, but to be honest, i'm a lazy pilot and I don't want to have to figure out 2 controls vs having everything on one package. If something could be done about the poor durability for the twist function,  I think you would have a product, but like I said, maybe it's just a defective joy.

UPDATE:  11/14 -- Upon ordering a replacement, that was fulfilled by Amazon.com for a new replacement. I received a clunky oversized box and the joystick in a bag. No packing materials like popcorn.

<Original review>
I wasn't onboard the No Man's Sky hype train prior to release.  I preordered a few days before release date, practically on a whim, just so I could get it quickly and try it out.

Initially, I was very pleased with the game:  it felt like early-days Minecraft survival mode on a galactic scale, and I felt almost like I was returning home.  If I would have reviewed it during that honeymoon phase, I would have given it 4, perhaps 5 stars, with caveats.

Earlier this evening, after having put several hours of gameplay into the game every day since release, I was determined instead to leave a 3-star review, based on the fact that the game is so very buggy.  I've had far too many crashes to count.  I once had a crash loop that ended with me crashing 6 times before I could make any progress in the game, and one of those crashes was on the title screen.  Actually, I've now had two separate crashes while on the game's title screen--I wish I had something witty to say about that, but I don't, so I'll just repeat it:  this game has already crashed twice on the very first screen it opens to, mere seconds after launching.

But everything has changed yet again, and not for the better, hence my current one-star rating.  This game's save feature is very poor:  you can manually save only at certain types of beacons on planets, and otherwise you auto-save when exiting your ship.  This may sound like a good system on the surface, but it's fatally flawed.  You cannot have multiple save files, so if your one save file ever becomes corrupt, or is saved during a certain-death scenario, then it is really and truly game-over.  This is exactly what happened to me.  I landed on a planet, and somehow (unknown to me at the time) my ship landed just inside a mountain (outside of the playable map).  When I exited my ship, my one and only save file was automatically overwritten with my character falling inexorably to their death below the surface of the planet.  Even using my jetpack, I cannot get back above ground or into my ship.  Dying only causes me to (lose my entire inventory, and then) reload and experience the same thing over again.  Manually reloading my game-save (via closing the application and restarting), of course, merely puts me right back at the beginning of the slow, inevitable fall to my character's ultimate doom.

Other developers know their games are buggy, and they make concessions:  multiple save-files, staggered auto-saves, etc.  Bethesda comes to mind.  Not so with Hello Games--they couldn't be bothered to safeguard their players' character data whatsoever.

I am utterly baffled that this game was seemingly not play-tested to any appreciable degree, yet it somehow managed to pass Sony's certification process.  I really, really liked this game after I started playing it, despite all its flaws, despite what we now know to be half-truths (being generous) from the developers prior to release, and despite what inevitably would have become mind-numbing boredom given a few more tens of hours of gameplay.  But this is a completely unfinished, unpolished, and ultimately unplayable piece of software.  It's obvious, given what I did see and enjoy during my time with this game, that the developers have vision and talent--which makes it all the more depressing that none of that matters since they couldn't be bothered work out the bugs prior to shipping (and/or day-one patching) the game.

I'm not sure who I'm more disappointed with:  the developers themselves, or publisher Sony who is obviously complicit in this farce.  This is a full-priced console game, published by the console-maker:  things have obviously gotten very much out of hand.  Until this incident, I have never thought that the entire concept of preordering games might be fundamentally flawed, but now I am determined to be much more careful with my limited gaming funds.  I feel like I got burned on a failed Kickstarter project that was rushed out in an unfinished state.  So I advise anyone similarly concerned to do what I now plan on doing:
* Don't preorder games, full stop.
* Read reviews from all the major trustworthy gaming publications before making a purchase.
* Check reddit threads, Amazon user reviews, and--for high-profile releases--even news articles for mentions of major issues like crashing, bugs, game-ending flaws, etc.
* Wait for one or even two major patches (beyond any day-one patch) before pulling the trigger on that sweet new game.

I think it's time to move to PC gaming--if my game is going to crash every two hours, it might as well be crashing in glorious 1440p60.  ;-)

Edit:
""A customer"" commented about the multiple auto-saves.  This undocumented (since the game auto-loads your most recent save file from the title screen) feature of having precisely *one* previous save file (not two) does exist:  there are merely ""current"" and ""previous"" save files.  Evidently, upon death, yet another auto-save is triggered:  another bad design choice.  Since both saves are in the exact same spot, this does me no good.  Both my saves are in the exact same doomed location, but minutes apart.  There is no third save file.

1.0,False,"07 15, 2014",A1DUWRMZVLRKAJ,B00AM217ZI,maskedgamer,"The worst online gaming experience of my life. I can honestly not put it any better than that. My brief and I mean very brief 2 weeks stay in this game has left me permanently scarred for life. Second Life can be summed up none better than a paradise for trolls,perverts, and the socially awkward.

Most of SL is about virtual sex as you will see have dressed characters and in game adult themed places and items pretty much everywhere. Even in non adult areas. You simply can't avoid it. Anyone who plays will lie to you and try to sell you the game as a ""virtual"" world where you can sight see and build things but that honestly makes up a small portion of the game. Maybe people did that 8 years ago but today those places are empty.

Second Lifes population has dwindled as people moved on with their lives but all thats really left are the type of people that you would more than likely not wish to be involved with in any life. Desperate housewives that use the game to virtually cheat on their husbands, lunatics that think the game is real and have substituted it for their actual life, Grown adult weirdoes that like to dress up as animals or role play as children (sure might sound innocent but nothing in this game is innocent), sexual predators and the sexually perverted mostly found playing something called Gorean or running around in rape cities, nerdy adults that want to be vampires, and above all else the worst crowd of all needy/clingy people that use Second Life to get a girlfriend or boyfriend because they fail to do so in the real world.

Its hard to play Second life without feeling pathetic or feeling pity for the people that do play it and have been playing it faithfully for years. Then theres the age old tale of My first life is great but they dump at least 80 hours a week into an online game. Give me a break. Youre real life sucks thus why your in SL trying to escape it. The common lie in second life is that its not a game but a virtual world. This will be told to you over and over again by the highly delusional players of second life. Second life IS a GAME. Just a very outdated one thats no longer relevant. Those that still think of it as a virtual world should perhaps actually catch up to modern times and see what other games youve been missing. If I had to sum it up Second Life is like Grand Theft Auto with the creativeness of Little big planet except without the fun and a terrible buggy platform and engine to build on.

Its a sandbox game where you decide what your fun should be. Its still a game and an MMORPG as everyone on there is role-playing. Either role playing that they're attractive as their avatar or role playing that this game doesnt suck. Its a virtual world as much as any MMORPG with a chat interface and zones to explore or any other online game. The only difference with second life is that the developers make RW money off the land players purchase to build their imaginary zones (which cost hundreds of real dollars youll waste).

So is the game good or is it bad? Well? As a game it was probably good maybe 6-8 years ago but it hasn't aged well. It has the graphics of Windows 95, the world is highly glitchy and buggy. Vehicles can hardly be used because so many places don't allow them and their buggy anyway even if you get to use them, the game crashes randomly and constantly, and to top it off the game is highly tolerant of its problems so they're never fixed.

If you enjoy games youve probably already played plenty better than this and ones albeit with saner people. The most normal folks youll encounter in this game are the trolls because the trolls now its a game and are there to get a laugh. Other players? Well they just seem someone lost mentally.

Some might think its harsh for me to say those things but until you venture into this world you wouldnt truly understand. Second Life is just a haven for delusional people with mental problems to bring their problems into a gave where they can live life as normal as they possibly can by pretending to be normal.

Tech support doesn't know how to fix, still waiting on tier 2 to call me as they claim they would to resolve my issue.

Issue #2  If I ever use it wireless, it randomly stops working.  It takes about 5 minutes to start working on it's own, or if I connect it to the usb cable it takes a minute to connect IF that worked, sometimes that doesn't work and I have to disconnect it and reconnect it again.

This game is right on top of the Starforce lists, found on any of the Boycott Starforce Websites.

Starforce is a copy protection program that installs hidden drivers on your computer, that aren't removed when the game is removed.

The problem is, over time, these drivers activate themselves, whenever and without warning, to check whether or not you are making copies ... of anything. These drivers are incompatible and uspurp and replace the actions of the correct drivers that came with your computer.

Optical multidrives are pretty darn expensive to replace. Mine is in the neighborhood of 500-600 dollars.  I don't want to lose it to a 7.50 game.

I already lost my  80 GB @ 5400 RPM hard dive after unwittingly downloading 3 Starforce games on my then newish Toshiba 17"" desktop replacement notebook with a P4 @ 3.2 Ghz processor, 1.5 GB RAM, a Toshiba super multi drive optical drive and a NVidia Geforce Fx Go 5200 graphics card.  My system has now been surpassed in technology...but it wasn't cheap when I bought it. I don't want to throw it away.

The games I downloaded were all very cheap and reasonable...I thought.

Beware and please check the lists for every game you buy.  Amazon has been wonderful about leaving Starforce posts and reviews up.

Amazon, you are wonderful.  This is a good place to buy.  Many online retailers would rather have you lose your computer to a 7.50 game than leave the warning posts up.

Starforce and the damage it causes is very real. It doesn't happen all at once, but it happens.  Have you gotten messages from Windows stating that your drivers have been misplaced and they are going to put them back where they belong?  That's just one of the peculiar happenings  that I experienced after Starforce.  I was losing so many drivers, I paid for a driver down subscription at a scanning site.  Good Golly Miss Molly ... it was a rough year.  It ended with my Genuine Copy of XP all of sudden not reporting as Genuine.

Can you imagine how hard it was to get a live warm body to verify product codes at Microsoft...pretty darn hard.

You can have all that and more, plus no computer if you download and install Starforced games or software.

Your choice...I wasn't aware of one at the time.

How I found out about Starforce?  I remembered the three games from when I started to have computer problems.  After my hard drive failed, I couldn't forget those games and looked up the titles to see if anyone else had noticed performance changes after installing them.  They did.

1.0,False,"11 17, 2010",AJ8VUUCO9RMX6,B003R3JNMI,D.L.,"Let me get straight to the point.  This game blows and is in my estimation, an early candidate for worst game of the year.  The history of Harry Potter hasn't always been a good one.  They have ranged from fair to acceptable, but have never really reached the heights of imagination from the rich source material that they came from.  However, you could not deny that they were each good, solid efforts with the next iteration improving from the one before it.  Then comes Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1.  Gone are the free roaming explorations of Hogwarts.  This time Harry and friends are on the run.  And with this one bold plot course in the book, goes any semblence of a decent Harry Potter game.  What developer EA Bright Light did so well in the previous game in terms of sandbox gaming is now replaced by a clunky third person shooter.  This gameplay change could have been a welcomed divergence to the previous games if only were the mechanics not so broken.

You start off playing as Harry with one main spell that eventually swells to half a dozen or so while progressing through the game.  I'm okay with the variety, yet I never found myself using anything other than the stupify spell which seemed more effective against enemies.  There is a cover mechanic yet good luck finding a barrier to hide behind that will stick and keep you from getting hit with spell projectiles.  The lock on mechanic is slippery and you'll often find yourself casting spells at empty air when it was focused on an enemy a second ago. Even more odd is that in some parts of the game, the view will shift from a third person perspective to a first person perspective without any rhyme or reason other than the developers trying to shake up the dull gameplay.  There was one instance in the game that literally had me tearing my hair out.  Harry is hidden under his invisibility cloak and must sneak around to accomplish a mission without being discovered.  Once the mission is over, Harry must then sneak back to the original point in which he started in order to trigger a cut scene.  The difficulty level then spikes and all of a sudden you're being discovered without anyone near you.  I must have tried this level a dozen or so times before I finally got past it, yet I have no idea if it was due to my skill or just chance.

The graphics are equally bad.  Though Harry, Hermione and Ron look detailed enough, they inhabit a world of muddy textures and dull environments.  The cut scenes seemed rushed and unfinished and failed to stitch together any semblence of a coherent plot.  Harry is given a mission to find the remaining Horcruxes, yet he then must partake in side missions that involve him sneaking out of a dragon's lair (don't ask how he got there), rescuing muggles and freeing captured wizards.  Weird.

I never expected a great Harry Potter game, but I could always expect a competent one that offered me a couple hours of fun as a fan of the series.  Deathly Hallows completely flipped the formula and instead offered a game so ugly and crippled by its gameplay mechanics that it's a shame that the best book in the series could not serve as inspiration for a good game.  There is a couple of months for the developer to correct their mistakes before the second part of this game is released in July of 2011 but I'm not holding my breath.",Stupified!,1289952000,32,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

I raced home, popped it into my GBA played it for about 15 minutes, got up, and left to go do something else. I love Mario Kart, and if your reading this review about Krazy Racers I'm sure you've played it and like it too, and thats what Krazy racers is, a copy of Mario Kart, only 10x worse. Somehow, there isn't much track variety. Sure you'll go from an ice level to a space level to a stadium, bit some how, all the tracks just don't differ much from each other, in difficulty or anything. The characters, unless you've dedicated your long lasting life to Konami, chances are you probably won't know a whole bunch of them. The weapons are basically the same as in Mario Kart, just slightly different, blue rocket, red rocket, drill, and junk like that. The gameplay, well, for me did not do all that much. I was never in a moment where I had sweat dripping down my forehead with my palms sweating loosing grip of the controller and worrying that on the final lap if I don't win first I'll have game over and won't make it to the Super Cup. I never had one of those moments like I did in Mario Kart, the whole game just didn't pull me in. Graphics, good.

There are also some video sequences and effects that don't happen at all, leaving you wondering what just happened.

It would be passable... IF the game could be played at all! The ""action"" happens on the top screen (WHY!? It doesn't even use 3D!) and to advance you must move a cursor around with the circle pad, that would be fine, IF it worked correctly: the cursor is crazy fast and it goes back to the center of the screen when you let go of the circle pad, that means you must be incredibly precise to select stuff, and sometimes the things you must use are either very small or very hard to identify.
The touch screen has what I would consider the worst touch menu ever, it's imprecise and completely useless. It's also horrible to look at, there's not even a background!

Resident Evil is another example of how you can make a games, which looks great graphically, but is barely playable in terms of controls.

To begin with, just to start the game you have to push the following sequence of buttons (or, more like ""push the same button so many times""): Start, X, X , X, X, X, Down, Down, X, X... Are you freaking kidding me???

And it's the same throughout the game: every time you need to go to a next Act, or to restart a game because you got killed, it's a miriad of X pushes. Even to upgrade a weapon you have to push X to select the upgrade, then confirm Upgrade by pushing X again, then confirm the confirmation by pushing X again, then when it's upgraded you have to push X yet again to the message that the upgrade has been installed. HOLY COW!!! Who in the hell did come up with this stupidity???

Now, I don't know why it was even considered as an option, let alone the ONLY option available, to completely STOP a player in his/her place to shoot and even to reload a gun. But it does seem like every playable character in the game is a complete idiot, unable to handle more than one task at a time: you can either move, or you can shoot, or you can reload your gun, but never the combination of moving and one of the other two.

Aiming is also weird: while you're rooted in place, you have to find where in the hell the laser line ends, which is nearly impossible without a full (stereo) 3D, because you can't really tell how far it ends, because it can be pretty much anywhere on the screen (not centered as in the majority of games where you have to aim).

The control scheme is the worst of all games in the world. I've complained on bad controls in other games, of course, but nothing comes close to RE5 in this regard: I doubt you can come up with the worst controls for decades to come.

As far as the storyline is concerned - it's japanese, so it's all ridiculously cheesy and convoluted, just like pretty much all other japanese games that managed to reach the West. I know some people might like it, so take this as my personal opinion :)

Before I begin let me say I've played Demons Souls, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Dark Souls 2 before this version. I put so much effort into liking Dark Souls 2 but I couldn't make it work, despite the amount of time and characters I made. Having loved and completed Bloodborne, Demons Souls, and Dark souls let me tell you why both Dark Souls 2 and the Scholar of the First Sin edition disappoint:

-Enemies have ridiculous tracking. They pirouette on their feet to laughable degrees despite how you may roll out of the way or run around them.
-Roll evading has been regulated to a separate attribute, which means your default one will be terrible unless you put some care into it. Not to mention the health points attribute, stamina, endurance... then maybe focus on some attack attributes. This means it's hard to find some points to through towards this new attribute which means your rolls will be near useless.
-Proximity alertness. By far this is the worst thing about it that's strangely gotten destructively worse in the new version. Basically if you attack an enemy, any enemy within a certain sphere's distance (think a giant bubble expanding from the center of the mob) will link and aggro you. I can't tell you the amount of times I've attacked someone then 5 enemies come pouring in from all directions, heights... it's mind boggling.
-I'll delegate this last point to the general complaints about the game you've probably seen already, which remain in this new edition somehow (having to load back to the ""hub"" to level up, this game's healing item identity crisis, etc)

I highly recommend Bloodborne and then Dark souls if you want a souls experience. They're refined, amazing games that are worth your money. Neither versions of Dark Souls 2 are worth of that.",Chances to Improve Fall Dreadfully Short,1445126400,8,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

First off, the reason I bought this game is because I had previously owned the second of these unleashed force games. The second is great, the only problem was that it is a bit short. Doesn't last long unless you play it through twice. It received a lot of negative reviews, but it honestly was very good. I'd recommend it highly. It's a fun game. However, the first of these games has way too much provocative clothing. One of the characters, Maris Brood, it actually partially naked in the game. I know that the game isn't rated for that, but it's true. The second game wasn't rated for language, but yet it had it, although only a couple words through the entire game. Yah, I knew that there would be a little bit of this revealing clothing when I bought the game, but I didn't know that it would be so bad. It really is worse than you'd think.

I find the game to be something of a yawner.  Why?  Because there is no battle continuity.  You are fighting as the French and if by some miracle you actually beat the Germans during one battle... well, that doesn't matter.  The next battle is the same historical battle that happened when the French actually lost.  Thus, why bother trying to change history if your efforts make no difference at all?

I have been playing computer games for 25 years of all types, from Zork, to King's Quest, to FPS games, and without a doubt, this game has the worst movement controls and combat system I've ever seen.  It is incredibly awkward to move, mainly because of the camera angles, which continually change direction. Sometimes the camera will be in front of you facing the character (almost always a terrible position if combat is involved), and sometimes it will switch to a bird's eye view and you wil be staring at the character's head.  Combat is awkward too due to the camera angles.  It's difficult to target certain monsters, and some you won't even know are there until they're right on top of you when the camera is faced forwards.  This just not make for a ""Scary"" gameplay experience, just frustrating.  I hate dying to what appears to be a very easy monster because the camera angle won't easily shift to it.  When the camera is in first person view, response time of the mouse is not very quick (you can't change this, even with your mouse), and trying to use the ""look"" cursor to view objects takes way too long.

In addition to this, the game is slow.  You can run, but combat moves are about half as slow as traditional games (even adventure ones).  And if you die, prepare to have to go through a lot of trouble to get back to your resume point, including having to go through the same cinematic sequences, since the game has very inopportune save points.

I won't be going back to the Silent Hill series without playing a demo of future games first.  This game almost would have been much better as an adventure game instead of an action game.  I'd rather watch the cinematic sequences and try to figure out puzzles than spend my entire time just trying to move around and fight.",Unplayable,1157155200,6,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

Six months after playing the game, I can't even remember what those triangular spirits were about. Thank goodness for the nice dialogue. Without it the game would be untolerable. Character interaction is minimal, and there is no real team spirit.
The main character Vaan and his friend Penelo seem to be nothing more than luggage. There's no point in them being in the game. I can't say that's a good thing.
The evil guys and side characters are lame and their doings seem pointless. As with the main characters, none are truly explored.
Talking with the townspeople is utterly pointless.

The graphics are nice, though nothing mind-blowing. I didn't want to stop to view the scenery at any point. I have to applaud them for making the cities even a bit lively looking, by adding a lot of silent characters. One point of complaint is the very lame spell effects.
The CGI scenes are nothing spectacular, definitely a step back from FFX. This was the first installment in the series where I wasn't looking forward to seeing the CGI scenes.

The voice-acting is good, all the main characters give solid performances. *But* the Marquis and Al-Cid almost succeed in spoiling my respect towards the other performances. Thank goodness they have so few lines. All in all the voice acting is one of the best aspects of the game.

The real-time battle system is a radical change from past games. It's nice but doesn't make the battles less tedious or repetitive in the long run. The enemies are also mostly boring.
The party AI doesn't really shine, but thank goodness you can limit its stupidity with the Gambit System. Too bad that lots of the useful gambits appear only at the later stages of the game.

The license board works for someone who likes perfect customization, but unfortunately I don't. I want characters who truly differ in their abilities. And talking about abilities, I found all the skills and most of the power ups really lame and useless.
The summons, called Espers, are stupid-looking and useless in combat.

The maps are at times annoyingly large. The fact that there are no secrets or secret places, and the randomized treasure, add to the insult. Many times the game devolved into a multiple hour running through empty fields, between short cutscenes.

The music is bad. Nobue Uematsu left them and they replaced him with some clueless punk. There is zero memorability and some themes are just annoying. It's the worst I've heard in any RPG I've played.

CLOSING COMMENTS:
When I started playing, I was positively surprised by the good voice-acting, the nice - and at times witty - dialogue and olden style of speaking used by some characters.
However it didn't take long to become annoyed by the pointless main character Vaan, the trite and stupid plot, lack of character interaction, huge and empty fields/dungeons with random and often useless treasure.

1.  Sorry, Ubi.  If you think that pirates are not going to think their way around this one, think again.
2.  SecuROM interferes with my burner.  I do a LOT of home video creation with Sony Vegas Pro ($500+ software).

It won't register in my computer, yet my other mice do. The lights turn on to indicate the mouse is obviously on, the official E-Blue drivers installed.

I bought a good E-Blue Mazer before, both wired and wireless, but this one just broke after barely a month of use. I did not use it all the time, the mice i have used a lot more still work. Even my one year old Logitech mouse i use at work still works.

To make matters worse, the lights really sucked, but i ignored it for i spent most of the time without the lights on. Additionally, the side buttons (Mouse buttons 5 & 6) stopped working after a month of use. But I cannot return the product because the return ""window"" passed which is irrelevant especially considering these products are supposed to be made to last at least a year.

Still, i love the feel and the way the mouse is designed to fit in the palm of your hand. Additionally, i love how easy it is to use the official E-Blue drivers for several of their mice. Additionally, i love how easy it was to switch between DPI settings.

Original review.

I was disappointed with this product, and should have read the 1/2* reviews before buying.  The regular review sites seem to have skimmed over a lot of the downsides with the product. I'll cover them here.

I was excited about the hardware potential and google really pushing the new android tv platform.  My expectations were that this would be able to replace my chromecast, roku3 and a windows PC I keep hooked up to the tv to stream what the prior two won't, which lately isn't much.

First off, the much vaunted voice search sucks.  It couldn't tell what I was saying part of the time.  I have two other google devices that fare better than this, and an alexa amazon device that gets it right 98% of the time.  Worse, when I said something like ""play Sons of Anarchy"", which I'm currently watching on netflix, it brought up the show with an offer to buy it from two premium services and skipped right over the fact that it was available to me for free on netflix.

Next is the lack of common android apps.  No browser, no email, no facebook, etc.  While I can (and did) sideload those, they aren't automatically updated and I couldn't even find a way for them to show up on the main screen.  While there probably is a way, I'd really like to run the same apps I can run on my wimpy 2 year old tablet on a premier flagship android device.

So I figured I'd at least try out some of the hundreds of games I own.  Pretty much nothing is compatible.  I went into dozens and dozens of apps and games and every one said 'incompatible'.  I even loaded the amazon app store and similarly, many apps don't show as compatible.  Of course, I can play older style console games bought from nvidia, and there is a streaming service that lets me play other apps.  But you have to pay for that and its not cheap.

Stream wise, this supports netflix and hulu.  No amazon video.  While the 2.0 release was supposed to bring HBO support, after upgrading the unit to 2.0 I saw nothing HBO related.  No NFL sunday ticket app, no NFL app, no WatchESPN.

My final take on this is if all you want to stream is Netflix and Hulu, you want to buy NVIDIA's game and streaming services, and you want 4k/60fps video from netflix, this is a nice box.  If you want to stream a reasonable full array of current streaming services (like a roku player can), you want to run routine android apps (like every phone/tablet can) or you want to game with play store or amazon app store games you already own, its hit and miss...mostly miss.",Disappointed,1444003200,6,{'Edition:': ' New'},

The brilliance of Hitman game was the uniqueness of it. You could go into a board and play it a thousand times and still not figure out all the different approaches. Also you had all these guns and things you could buy and add each board. So many things that made Hitman, Hitman for the first 3 are all gone in this one.

I was pretty disappointed that a game I waited for so long to play was so unfulfilling at the time. The story is pretty dry and lacking of anything exciting really. the gameplay itself is pretty good and not anything out of the ordinary with regard to a FPS. I do feel that the character classes are a bit too limited with not much in the way of abundance of abilities gained as you level. Also on the subject of leveling, I do not in any way care for leveling to 20 and then having to then ""level"" the rest of the way relying on finding equipment that contains ""light"", which is a form of leveling currency. Why not just utilize a basic structure like other games where you get kills, complete missions, etc and experience is awarded therefore leveling your character?

Where the true issues come with this game aside from the simple, not very interesting story is the connectivity and bugs. This game is terrible when it comes to actually staying connected to the online servers. You WILL get booted at least a couple times on any given play session. Just the nature of it, and hopefully you aren't about to accomplish something important and/or difficult where you will have to redo it.

1.0,False,"03 18, 2009",ADPEAVHFCNLLC,B001CMJAP6,Poisoned Blade,"It's like Square and Microsoft brainstormed every possible way to ruin a strategy game and still have it be sorta fun.

Concept:  9/10
The Last Remnant is turn based strategy game set in a fantasy universe created by the masterminds who created Final Fantasy.  You play as a young adult named Rush.  Rush's sister has been kidnapped by villains that want to use her innate magical abilities to take over the world.

You can access areas through a World Map.  There are towns where you buy weapons and equipment, or even craft your own.  There are also dungeons and battlefields where you fight enemy Squads and Bosses.

You advance through the game by fighting turn-based Battles.
You hire Warriors, Mages, and Leaders and form them into several Squads.
The number of Units in a Squad = the number of attacks that Squad gets per round.  (Each Unit attacks per turn.)
The Squad's HP is the combination of the Units' HP.  As long as the HP is above 0, ALL of the Units in that Squad can keep attacking.  If the Squad's HP = 0, all of the Units in the Squad die at the same time.
You can issue commands to the Squads during the battle, like ""Charge"", ""Heal"", ""Attack with Magic""...
After the Battle, all of your Units are resurrected and improve based upon what they did during the battle.

In a Battle, you cannot retreat, and if you lose, you must return to your last Save.

Sounds Awesome... now here comes an avalanche of flaws that ruin the game.

Technical Art:  1/10
Square licensed an old version of Unreal before it had streaming.  As a result, there are Load Screens everywhere!  The game also is hindered by the most slowdown that I've seen since Aladdin fought Jafar on the SEGA Genesis.  Textures and Bump-Maps constantly pop in and out whenever characters or scenes are rendered.  It's incredibly distracting and makes your Xbox 360 feel like a PC with a 9 year old graphics card.  However, you can avoid most of these bugs, by installing the game on your 360 Hard Drive and playing it from there.

Gameplay:  2/10
During Battles, when you give orders to your Squads, you only get a few options per turn.  These options seem completely random.  There are many times when a Squad is at Full Health and you get an option to Heal them.  However, when a Squad is low on HP, sometimes the Heal Option doesn't show up, causing you to lose a battle.  There are other times when you fight an enemy and you're thinking, ""My Poison Gas Attack is perfect for this.""  But it doesn't show up in your Command List.  Whoever thought of taking the Player's Options away in a Turn Based Battle Game was a good idea, is clearly insane.  Too often, you are forced to make bad decisions because the options you want just aren't available when you need them most.

Even when you do get the commands that you want, sometimes the characters ""REASSESS"" and ignore your commands and do something different.  If your Squad's Leader gets KO'ed with a spell, it's called a BOTCH and the AI takes control of that Squad.
It feels like the game is doing everything possible to take control away from you in a game where the fun is supposed to come from you commanding your army.  As long as the AI is good, this usually isn't too much of a problem...

AI: 3/10
At times Allied Squads join you.  You cannot give them commands and they act on their own.  Sometimes, they attack enemies for 20 points of damage instead of healing one of your Squads, restoring 2000 HP!  The AI is so bad, you'd swear that Leroy Jenkins hacked into your 360 through your live account and he's controlling the Allies.

BOSSES:  2/10
Because of the AI and Gameplay issues, the Bosses feel incredibly cheap.  Also, all of their Health Bars show up as ???.  You have no idea how many HP they have.  When they are close to death, their Health Bar flashes red, but that's the only hint that you get.  Bosses attack hard enough to take out an Entire Squad, or Charm them and make them fight on their side.  If you have 3 Squads, and the Boss decides to Charm all 3, you lose!  There are times when you don't get the commands that you need to win the battle at the times you need them, causing you to die.

QUESTS:  4/10
Most of the Quests are of the dungeon crawl variety.  You gain access to a dungeon and fight to an objective with an AI companion.  Most of them are ok, and some are horrible.  One Quest in particular has you running through a barren desert for 12 minutes, touching posts.  The only way to Identify them is to touch them and if you touch the wrong one in the wrong order, you have to start over.  It's got all of the excitement of your Gym Coach making you run 3 miles in real time.

ART: 5/10
Slowdown aside, the art is very dull.  The lighting is very dark throughout the game and colored lighting is pretty non-existent.  Everything looks dull and drab, like you're watching the game through a dirty window.  The Character Designs are interesting, but lack the Style found in the Final Fantasy series.  Another issue arises when your army fights another humanoid army.  The characters in the battle look nearly identical, so it is really difficult to tell who is who.  When you see a guy swing an axe at an identical guy and a 1000 appears above the injured character, you don't know whether to cheer or panic.

WRITING: 3/10
If you're looking for an epic script, look elsewhere.  The dialogue in this game is as epic as 2 third graders talking about their lunchables.  The lines are delivered like the actors are in a breakfast cereal commercial where the first 5 ingredients are Sugar.
Rush's Battlecry, ""YEAH, Everybody is getting HYPED!""  He says stuff like, ""Yo Dave, whassup?""  ""Yeah, No Prob. Whatever...""

Another annoyance is that the team reversed the Critial Hit Dialogue, so when your characters critical hit the enemy, they say what they would have said if they had gotten critically hit.  If you do 5000 damage to an enemy, your character is likely to grumble, ""Aww shucks.""

BROMANCE:  0_o /10
Homophobes beware.  The first major NPC that you speak to is an aging bartender at the Tavern.  He calls you ""Cutey"" and hits on you.  In all fairness, your character is feminine and he's wearing leather chaps as a fashion statement.  Later on, Rush meets Dave, a flamboyant magistrate, and they get along better than any other two characters in the game.  In one scene Dave gives Rush a flower and they gaze into each other's eyes.  Normally, Rush replies with a nonchalant ""whatever"" to the other NPC's but if Dave says something, Rush says, ""Aww, I can't say no to you.""  If the enemy surrounds you, they can attack with a ""REAR ASSAULT"" and Rush says, ""They caught us with our pants down!""  So, after a while, the game starts to feel like Brokeback Kingdom.

ECONOMY:  1/10
Rush is the only character that you can equip, and it seems like once you buy a decent sword, there's no reason to get another one until Disk 2.  The game has a crafting system, where you can make things for Rush, but the parts are so rare, it's not even worth searching for them.  Also, 90% of the items that you can create are the same as items that you can buy.  Your NPC's equip themselves and manage their own gear.  Sometimes, they'll ask you for something in the inventory and you have the right to refuse.  But if you refuse, the NPC just becomes less effective.

The Game is Rated M for Blood, Language, Violence and Suggestive Themes (between males)

Overall, the game is at least 50 hours long full of Quests and Side Quests.  At times, the game is fun and the cutscenes are pretty good.  Your Characters do improve after almost every battle, so it does feel rewarding.  It's a semi-decent way to kill time in small doses.  But, the lack of control that you have over your army is incredibly frustrating and the homosexual undertones as well as the juvenile dialogue can get on your nerves.

If you're dying for a turn based strategy game for the 360, and don't mind playing it from your hard drive... and all of the stuff I just wrote about doesn't bother you... Buy this game.

Avoid this game if you hate Slowdown, Bromances, Bad Art, Load Screens, Dull Quests, Awful Dialogue, or if you actually want to control your soldiers in a strategy game.
Note:  There is also a bug that prevents you from getting 200 Achievement Points when you finish the game.

Now though, the internet connection bit is so angering for the game that this is supposed to be.  I have a good connection, I still have Wow players in my house so I know that part is good, but not having the EA server up that you have your little towns on (this game is all towns vs the cities of old) for no good reason is just so sad.  From the 60-70 hours I have gotten in I did like the look of the game, very pretty and some of the cutsie things were good (though bummed that the sim doesn't go back to the same house every night, the heck???)
I have always looked forward to the next Sim City game but I think I am done with them now since so many games are going to that format.  Guess it is time to grow up that last little bit.

However, I stuck with it and eventually grew to love the game.  That just hasn't happened with The Sims 3.  I have tried to like it.  I really have.  My god how I have tried.  But I just can't.  The menu navigation is atrocious.  I spent half my time playing the game in build mode trying to find out how to build! It's cluttered and completely unappealing.  The seamless neighborhood feature intrigued me, but when my Sims that I had worked hard on moved out without my consent, I was pretty upset.  I don't really play the actual game very much, but I love to build in The Sims.  I rarely make any Sims at all.  I just love building houses.  One thing I loved about The Sims 2 was the ability to create new neighborhoods and place lots at your leisure.  I was SEVERELY disappointed to find out that this was impossible in The Sims 3.

After I spent all night waiting for Uplay to download the game, which by the way would have only taken me an hour with Steam, the ga,e freezes with a black screen after you launch the game. The Farcry 4 title pop-up and then the game goes into window mode and stops from there. After and hour of frustration and trying everything in the book from restart to making sure my anti-virus and firewall are working properly I reinstalled the game again over night and nothing worked. From there I went to the forum of Farcry which is Ubisoft and saw that ton's of people are having the same issue from Downloaders to people who bought the install disc.

Then Ubisoft comes out with a day one patch. But that didn't work either. Later I stubble across something interesting on the forums. People started to unplug certain USB devices and that's when the started to play. Apparently  Ubisoft doesn't like you to have more than one keyboard plugged in at the same time, or gamepad, or wireless controllers. So if you have Multiple USB gaming devices plugged in and Farcry isn't starting, just start unplugging and eventually it should work.
I am not happy with this work around but I can at least try and enjoy this poorly released game. This will most likely be the last time I buy a Ubisoft game. Ubisoft had plenty of time to work this out and should have known that PC gamers have a wide variety of gaming devices. PC gamers are not console gamers and the software should be built for the ultimate PC gamer. I have a Keyboard, a Gaming Key-pad, and a Wireless controller. I should be able to have all three plugged in and use which ever I please without the game freezing up.
I was amazed at the fact that the game instantly stopped working the moment that I plugged in one of my gaming devices that it didn't like.

Where to begin with my frustration in playing this game?
I'll begin by comparing it to the FAR superior Battlefield 3.

BF3 rewards teamplay MORE than any other shooter I can think of out there.
Even if all you're doing is healing players, giving ammo or spotting enemies your contribution to the team is vital to their success.
Anyone who plays in a run-and-gun fashion will almost always get punished by an coordinated team on the opposing side.
It forces people to play in a realistic fashion, sticking in groups, calling out targets and taking on obstacles like a puzzle.
Eg; a tank rolls up on a sniper and his friend who both lack explosives to take down the vehicle. The friend pulls out his smoke launcher and immediately starts laying a carpet of smoke toward a building they soon take cover in. Meanwhile a group of team-mates come in under the cover of smoke following the tank, plant C4 and detonate it. The tank operator dies miserable and alone.
  Aside from the awesome gameplay in BF3, the game mechanics (although not perfect) functioned beautifully and rewarded players that took the time to learn them and coordinated with friendlies.

When DICE developed Battlefield 4 they took the game-engine apart and put it back together in the wrong order.
The game-mechanics are buggy: Ironsights take five minutes for the textures to load, reloading times are inconsistent, hit-detection is awful (sniping a guy's head doesn't always kill...). And there are so many other bugs I could name but don't have the time to remember or mention.

As well as the bugs, DICE purposely changed the whole mechanic of the game. Some weapons have ridiculous amounts of recoil, shotguns are over-powered and can kill targets from great distances, sniper-rifles are dialed at 100 meters by default (meaning you have to aim below a target instead of above), Long-range scopes are no longer an option for assault rifles (meaning it's difficult as an assault-class to take down those pesky snipers), ladders were removed from several levels because players were complaining about the non-linear combat of Battlefield.

There's so much about this game I hate. It's not even like previous Battlefield, it's a Call of Duty wannabe.
At least Call of Duty can get their game mechanics to operate smoothly and reward a player who's familiar with older COD games.","This game is trash, not fun.",1449878400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

1.0,False,"06 22, 2008",A2KBD1UW414PH2,B000V1OUTU,Greg,"I bought the collector's edition and if you do too, you can have the enjoyment of not playing the game like I did. Don't get me wrong here, the game plays after a very lengthy scan of the local data files. But all those ""in-game"" exclusives aren't on your character. You'll hit the [...] wesite and find that there aren't any useful support options. I recommend you do what I did and Google your problem. With any luck you'll stumble across some 3rd party message board where you'll find a post about the ""/claim"" command that gives your character these items.

Sadly, the support infastructure is soooo bad on this MMO, that you'll spend a lot more time trying to fix stuff and looking up solutions then you will playing the actual game. The forums for the game do exist, but there hidden in the subpages of AgeOfConan [...]... good luck. It's like a quest in itself.

Now I haven't even touched on how buggy half the game content is, and how broken the classes are. These aren't unique problems, like a bugged quest here or there. That kind of stuff is expected, no MMO escapes that. But this is a whole new level of bugs. For example, it is quite noted that the assassin's hide spell (stealth) is a 50/50 hit and miss affair. When I say hit and miss, I mean, you'll get all the fancy annimation and to the player you'll look hidden. The annoying fact, comes when you realize that the MOBS didn't get the memo...

""Dear Facemelting MOBs,

Yes all 5 of you, please note that player ""RogueGinsuDeath200"" is stealthed, please do NOT attack him unless he unstealths, or gets too close to you. He should not be detected from 6 game meters as his ""Hiding"" skill is maxed out. to do so would greatly embarass the game developers, and they in turn will convert all of you into neurtal NPC squirrels.""

If you're stealthed, you should not be detected in the same manner that you would be if you weren't ""stealthed"". A rogue that can't hide, that's like having a warrior that can't swing a sword.

While this game has a lot of potential, there is NO doubt in my mind that in it's current state, it should not have been released. I'm not new to MMORPGs; you will get bugs here and there, regardless of the title/developer. But this is the first time I've seen the actual character/class set fundumentally flawed. That said, if you want to give it a shot, go for it. Who knows, maybe they'll fix it up enough to make it enjoyable.

And to no avail mind you: all these games received ZERO protection from their draconian DRM scheme when it came to preventing their piracy!

Exactly like Spore, for which the customer backlash was heard around the world, EA is trying to force this DRM scheme down its customers' throats than do the reasonable thing: listen to them.

Since piracy will always be a factor to consider and everyone has the right to protect his investment, a form of DRM will also always exist. But, at the same time, this gives no one a free hand in entrapping and exploiting their own customers. Or using piracy as a thin pretext to slip snoopware into our computers!

- Revoking our rights as the Administrators of our own computer by creating irremovable folders or registry entries or subroutines that run masked is unacceptable!
- Bundling a snooping, auto-updating and in-secret-contact-with-the-mothership utility that retains backdoor access to our computers is unacceptable!!
- Trying to force legitimate gamers to pay again and again for the same game by Limiting its Installations is UNACCEPTABLE!!

I am sure that, in the end, the best and more effective DRM method will prove to be very simple: reasonable pricing. Who would place his computer in danger of Trojans, Worms or slow Viruses for $20? And since even more people would buy the game, everyone should be happy. But fighting piracy was never what EA is aiming for.

Let's be honest: datavoring SecuROM subroutines and Limited Installations have NOTHING TO DO WITH FIGHTING PIRACY. They aim at making us pay for the same game AGAIN & AGAIN and preventing us from ever reselling our copies.

6.  People walk through people, cars jam up into each other.
7.  There was a logjam of people at the entrance to the restaurant, and they ended up dying.
8.  You find yourself ""mourning"" and don't know why until you figure out that there are various tombstone markers
  around town from Sims that have died, that you have to put in your inventory and place them at the cemetery.
9.  Once you choose an outfit/hair-- you cannot change them.

11. Books- I have no idea how to read certain ones (i.e., cooking) once I've purchased them.  Once they are

The camera controls are especially heinous by binding movement to the analog stick and camera to the D-pad. This may not sound too bad if you have two left thumbs, but for those of us with normal digits, it causes enemies, which constantly bolt back and forth across the field, to get out of your FoV with the only way to turn is to stand still and operate the D-pad. There is a lock on function, but because of the speed many enemies move, they frequently break the lock on and leave you staring at a wall. This is especially noticeable with a dragon-type boss very early on who has 8 different target spots but you'll never hit any of them because of how often it rips across the screen, leaving you to chase after it just so it can do it again and plow into you.

Normally broken controls would be enough, but the difficulty, dear god the difficulty. You'll be effortlessly hacking your way through groups of enemies, despite the camera, only to come onto a boss who will kill you before you even realize you're taking damage.

Sadly, the rest of it is rather fun. The sci-fi fantasy style of the game is interesting and the combat, when enemies are actually where you can see them and aren't insta-killing you, is quite enjoyable.

1.0,False,"11 15, 2008",AWAGSXM9CNZCC,B00149PCAO,An Android Fan,"Fanboys out there are likely to send their wrath, so let me preface this review by making it clear that I wanted to enjoy this game. I loved the demo and was looking forward to playing the full game. I just today rented it and started playing it and was truly enjoying the game.

This game could've been great. It should've been great. It had so much potential. And it is different. It truly is unlike most games that come out. It has the player utilize the environment to escape the ever vigilant waves of police, both on foot and in the air via helicopter. The emphasis is on exploration and evasion.

Unfortunately this is one reason why combat is so short-changed. On the times when the only options are to fight or die (and there are plenty of them) the combat is extremely difficult. Many fights can be avoided but for some the only way to avoid being ventilated is to take down the enemy.

And as I write this I do so after attempting to escape the mall. There is a section which no matter what I do, I die. If I fight the SWAT, I die. If I try to wall run to the pipe I am supposed to swing from then leap to the catwalk above and then the next section, somewhere in there I die. Either I miss because there is so much gunfire and small, minute changes in direction that are crucial to making the jump successfully are impossible to make (you'll get shot since Faith, the lead character, can't seem to shimmy over on the pipe any faster) If I actually do make the jump and land, it doesn't matter because I become a lead sponge.

Another large problem that bogs this game down is the simple fact that the shooting never seems to stop. There are far too few respites and these all stop far too quickly, forcing the gameplay to be relegated to repetitive and annoying. I was hoping to be able to explore and look at the city in all of its beauty. Unfortunately the constant gunfire makes this goal impossible.

Speaking of repetitive, the game would've been far better if it wasn't so linear. The devs hint at looking for alternative paths. Don't bother looking for them. They don't exist. The game has one way it wants you to complete an area and it will beat you over the head until you figure out what that one way is. Until then you will see ""Loading"" many, many times.

And it's a real shame too because some of the most exhilarating gaming moments that a player may see can be found in this game. Without giving anything away, the subway has one such moment, as does a construction level. There's a really good chase scene fairly early in the game too. Immersion is handled extremely well. For years gamers could never see their hands or feet. In this game they can and the camera never pans out. Ever. If you make a roll, the camera will do a very fast 360, just like in real life. As you run you see your hands moving back and forth quickly and they change position as you gain momentum, and Faith's breathing gets heavier as she runs faster and for longer periods of time.

Dice, in the slight chance someone from your company reads this, in the future, don't just test your game for bugs and glitches. Test the game to ensure that it will be fun. Don't give us a great concept and bog it down with terrible, frustrating gameplay. I do understand that you're owned by EA Games, the Walmart of the video game industry but I am sure that even they are willing to give you a little more time to work on the game and ensure that gamers will thoroughly enjoy what you have to offer.

In all honesty Dice, I truly do want to see a sequel to this game. I do want to see this franchise succeed. I want to see you take video gaming in a new direction and I believe that this game is that first step, so I am saying all of this in the hopes that when you take that next step, it will be a good one. I really did not want to write this. I did not start playing Mirrors Edge hoping to find things to criticize. I really wanted to enjoy this game and I am truly saddened that I simply cannot do so. Please make another game that is like this one, only without the needless frustrations. If you do that, and you can find ways to improve on what you did right, and you did do a lot right, then perhaps my future reviews of your games will look more like the other two that are here on Amazon as of the time of this writing.","Excellent Original Concept, Inexcusably Terrible Execution",1226707200,65,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

From terribly repetitive levels with re-spawning enemies, to it unnatural flight controls and a bad targeting system; 'Iron Man' manages to fail at damn-near everything it tries to do.  This is the best-example of every criticism of a ""movie game"" I've ever seen.
Sure, each level in the 'Iron Man' world is huge and gives a good impression of NOT being in a fish-bowl like some other games do.  At the same time however, the graphics to that world are flat-out disgusting.  In my opinion, for what is supposed to be a next-gen game, 'Iron Man' may be the worst-looking yet.
The ability to upgrade your armor is a nice new spin, but, unfortunately, just can't overcome the fact that everything else is going so completely wrong.  Even the voice acting is lousy.

This is easily one of the worst RPGs I have ever had the misfortune to play.  Ever.  The plot is contrived at best due in part to an absolutely ATROCIOUS translation (which can't settle on how to spell the names of important places/people).  The psuedo-new-age music seems to be interesting for the first five minutes, but the utter lack of variety in the soundtrack had me wanting to claw at my eardrums so I wouldn't have to suffer through it any more.

The battle system is very broken; you could be standing right in front of a monster and still not hit it no matter how much you swing at the fool thing.  The upgrade system you use for your equipment is also fundamentally broken.  You need to repair your weapons and armor every few monsters you kill; more often if you use the special abilities certain items grant you.  And this is VERY expensive.  I was so frustrated because it seemed like by the time I'd killed enough monsters to recoup the cost of the last repairs, it was time to repair again.

The only redeeming feature of this game is the graphics.  Even though they're a little crude by today's standards, they're still nice to look at in some cases.  Also, the character model will change depending on your equipment, so your character could be running around with a pumpkin on her head or a metal pot on his head.

Not just similar ideas but an outright copy.  I suppose imitation is a form of flattery but these guys are five to ten years behind the times (if not 20).  We simply do not make these types of games anymore except for low end devices like cell phones.  It's not a particularly good game which is why it costs half as much as a standard game (actually less).  Literally second rate.  Probably a failed game they had to lower the price on to sell.  The game is very mediocre in game play but where it really falls apart is the RPG element.  Unlike diablo which has a pretty rich RPG element for so simplistic a game, this one is paper thin and goes nowhere.  After hours and hours and hours and yet more hours playing this, the plot is little more then, one day, everyone woke up and the world was invaded by beings from another realm.  The plot is not advanced through any means except an extremely cheap, find a scrap of paper to read something left behind....almost all of it drivel.

Here is what is not obvious.  There are six classes, you get to choose two and a certain amount of point to put in either class to tap skills from each.  Unique?  Guess again.  A handful of combinations are viable, most are not and a couple are far superior to others.  Nab a trainer and in a couple of hours you can play any combination you want to compare and contrast.....and you have to, or your combination will be poor and a mediocre game becomes a terrible one.  Basically, it boils down to which clickable skill you want as a primary attack and which as secondary and what passive skills you want....all other choices being wasted.  But hey, at least you get to reroll.

Or rather, I got to the very end and discovered a simple, game stopping bug having to do with skeleton keys where, because of a quest that failed to trigger, it, not only is impossible for me to get through the last door on the last zone but I cannot return to town.  Congrats.  officially earned negative stars for wasting my time with the most basic, easy to fix stuff that should not have made it past beta.  I am tempted to say no one noticed because no one bothered to finish the game.  Why?  Because its just mindless waves of mobs with endless left clicking without thought or skill.  You can run through and make sure the entire fog of war has been explored but why bother.  The RPG element is just terrible.  Started out strong but just did not follow through.  Far worse then Diablo III (and that is a mighty sore subject among the diablo fanbois).

But upon playing it I thought it was rather enjoyable especially when i saw that the full game would have free roam. I received the game yeasterday and also found out that the makers of burnout paradise were involved so i figured it'd be even better than expected. WRONG! Thank god i bought this on sale and not full price (i wouldn't have anyway)

A few weeks after the demo released it was closed, i wondered why as it was a demo not a beta, Well now i know. Because the demo and the game are the same thing just with and online mode and ""SINGLE PLAYER ONLY"" free roam. what fun is free roam in single player alone? when every other racing game (including burnout) has online free roam, in which u can run around with friends find and show them shortcuts fool around ect... Instead what is available is 3 modes. The cops vs speeders (like in the demo) the 1 on 1 race (which i also believe was in the demo) and the regular multilayer race. (which is in every racing game)

And unlike most racing games today it has no custom soundtrack support. The have a soundtrack option in the options menu ""WHICH IS NOT USABLE"".

""If George Lucas and the folks at Lucas Arts who are responsible for this game care about the future of Star Wars games ... or the future of their jobs, they will release a SERIOUS patch to this game that fixes the many, many problems that are here.""

Well, they've released a patch, but it's certainly not everything we wished for.

I was very upset over this game when I first bought it. It had so many bugs and so many annoying story/plot holes that it was ""painful"" to play at times. Obsidian and Lucas Arts just released a patch for the game that addresses a few of the problems I was having ... but there really isn't much they could do about the holes in the story (because they rushed the game to stores instead of letting the designers finish the game).

Once patched, KOTOR 2: The Sith Lords is more fun to play ... similar to the original KOTOR. The only thing that prevents it from getting a perfect score on the fun scale is the fact that there are still a few holes in the story/plot (HUGE chunks that are completely missing). That, and since it was rushed there are some parts of the game that are just ""underdeveloped"" (meaning it's hard to understand what is going on in parts because the writers/designers didn't have time to put in the needed story elements so that players clearly understand what's going on.

My overall rating of the game has improved since the patch because I don't have ""as many"" annoying crashes and performance problems. I would now give it a 2.5 or 3 stars overall.

It doesn't place you in a heart-pounding story.  It doesn't allow you to earn your rank or flying wings.  It doesn't even permit you to feel any empathy for the characters in the game.  It is, quite frankly, a mish-mash of nonsense that's been wrapped up in a shiny box of failure.

The game starts out with absolutely no connection to the previous game--which isn't altogether a bad thing.  Nevertheless, you have no idea who you are, why you're there, and what your background is.  You first mission is in the shoes of an Air Force Colonel who gets shot down during combat.  And then you start jumping from one pilot to another, from mission to mission.  How does this make any sense?  In one mission you're in the middle east as an American pilot; in another, you're a British RAF pilot doing a training mission; in another you're a Russian fighter jock.  Why?  If anything, all this jumping about is childish.  In fact, it is so laborious that an arcade game feels more enjoyable than this $50 piece of gold malarky.

Ok, forget the characters.  What about the flying?  Surely a game made for flying will give you a somewhat real experience as a fighter job, right?  Absolutely not.  Sure, each fighter has strengths and weaknesses, and you can feel the difference between an F-16 and an A-10.  That being said, you are never permitted to take advantage of each individual plane's unique attributes.  In one mission you're flying an A-10 on ground runs--so far so good.  Then suddenly you're to turn around and dogfight with Russian MiGs.  This is a ridiculous proposition for anyone who knows even a little bit about these planes.  An A-10 is called a ""Tank Buster"" for a reason--it doesn't do dogfights.

The game also added a new feature where you're allowed to take off and land your plane.  Purportedly, this is because many players of the last game complained of the lack of realism.  To address the problem, the developers here just make you turn around and land at an airbase at the end of the mission.  Why?  Maybe some people might enjoy the prospect of landing a fighter jet--sure, I'll give you that.  But the game provides absolutely ZERO training on landing a plane or taking off or anything of the sort.  You're merely thrust into it as if you should already know how to work the controls, what the proper method is to land these fake planes.  Hell, if the game merely kept score of how you landed, that would be something.

H.A.W.X. doesn't give you a feeling of accomplishment.  You don't win for your skill in dogfights.  You don't win because you picked the right plane for the mission.  You don't win because you correctly guessed that a particular loadout would be important for your objectives.  Nope--the game makes those choices for you.  In fact, the only reason you tend to win the missions is because you're supposed to.  Fire off enough missiles (you get about 150-200 per mission per loadout) and an infinite amount of canon ammo, and you're bound to hit something.  Nonsense.

This game is a far cry from the Ghost Recon series.  At least those games give you a considerable amount of realism.  It's another world away from MWII, where you feel compelled to fight because of the story and characters and realism.  This game is totally devoid of any likeability.

Fighting is slow boring and tedious. I have no idea what type of game ubisoft was trying to make.

When your in a battle with enemies they stand around and do nothing but attack and interrupt the minute you try to attack. Its like the game developers are trying to piss you off.

1.0,False,"09 28, 2010",A325TSWX3H1W4K,B004774IPU,M.G.,"I'm writing this review as honestly and impartial as I can, from the prospective of someone that has played the civilization franchise for over 13 years.

Plain and simple, they dumbed down and washed out the game to make it more attractive and simple for a broader market. If you are a civilization fan, or enjoyed Civilization 4 for its strategy difficulty, its complexity and micro-management as well as the decission making problems and interaction with the AI, then save your money and don't buy this game, because all that is practically gone.

The game has been so streamlined and simplified that is border line irritating for someone that has played civilzation for the past decade. The cool changes regarding combat system, resource limitations, hexagonal grid, (which are great don't get me wrong) simple go out of the window when you are faced with a game that honestly seems to be geared to children and very casual gamers that don't like to think too much and see more action.

Added to that, is the poor (and by poor I really mean HORRIBLE) shape they shipped the game. I've had BETAs of games that were in a better shape than this. The amount of glitches, bugs, crashes and general game issues in Civilization 5 are just borderline un-acceptable. And to get the cherry on the cake, they force you to install and launch the game using STEAM, which is an online based service. So, doesn't mather if you bought your nice little CDs, you still have to go through Steam to install it, and use it. Now, Steam by itself is another company that has a reputation for very low quality services, and in this case they haven't improved anything. I suggest you go through the forums of Steam or 2k games and see the quantity of people that are days without been able to install or play normally their game just because of issues with Steam, in top of that you get the issues of the game itself which are below BETA quality.

The cool looking graphics, leaders in 3D talking their languages, and the incredible simplification (I won't go into detail because it's a lot) of the game simply screams ""geared for children, consoles and toysRus shelves"". Our beloved Civilzation strategy game is gone, completely.

So again, if you are new to the series and like a simplified strategy game to start, this is good for you. If you are an old civilization fan, or someone who enjoys strategy games for its complexity and micro-management then save yourself irritation and boredom and go out to have a nice dinner with those $[...] bucks.

I find most people like that enjoy easy to defeat enemies and lame AI.

My rating may seem harsh..but trust me. Download and play the DEMO first. You will get the idea very quickly. PREY also made huge claims that it was going to be THE game to beat. HA HA HA HA HA!!!!!! Too funny!

If you have played HL2, DOOM 3 or FEAR...you will be biored with this lamer.

PREY does offer 2 new concepts and 1 KIND OF new concept...gravity, your character is an American Indian and portals.

AMERICAN INDIAN -

The main character is an American Indian...or native American. I really liked this! In real life, I am 6' tall, I lift weights and look like I just stepped out of a DOOM 3 Marine platoon mission. I am sick of playing stereotypical, blond haired, crew cut, muscle bound guys. I really enjoyed being an American Indian. Yiour character has a super power...he goes into the ""spirit"" world which allows him to travel and do things his mortal body cannot do. NICE TOUCH! This was definitely a fresh, new angle for gameplay.

GRAVITY -

They threw the rules of gravity out the window. You can walk upside down, side ways etc. This is very nice because you get lost/confused sometimes. It does mess with your middle ear a bit. lol However, this does get old after the first 1-2 hours of gameplay.

PORTALS -

Enemies appear from portals. Instead of enemies pre-planted and waiting for you, they pop out from portals. This is nice. You cannot always attack from behind and it is surprising when they swarm you. The problem is...there is just noit enough challenge to the fights or enough clever AI in the enemies to keep you hooked. Some bob and jump...kind of reminds me of the old days of DOOM. Yes!! The enemies were that predictable.

NOW TO REVIEW THE REST OF THE GAMES FEATURES.....

WEAPONS -

Lame, uninspired and nothing that really gives you goose bumps. Even the weapon sound effects were too ""quiet"" with no umppphhh behind them.

MUSIC -

OK. Not bad. Then again...nothing great. Some old classic rock songs thrown in to give an earthy feel.

VOICE ACTING -

Down right horrible. No emotion, no feeling, no soul behind any of it. The grandfather was the only believable voice. Very lame script too. Down right awful altogether.

GRAPHICS -

Nothing new. Not as beautiful as Doom 3, Fear or Half-Life 2.

GAMEPLAY -

OUCH! Talk about a YAWN fest! I kept waiting for some challenging , visceral battles. NOTHING! Everything was predictable and easy to beat. Basically, you spend your entire time winding your way through a space complex. PREDICTABLE. You will find blocked paths and locked doors. PREDICTABLE. Creatures will try to stop you. PREDICTABLE. As soon as you start wal;king on the upside down paths, creature teleport in to attack you...everytime! PREDICTABLE...dear God it was PREDICTABLE!!! Weenies that can't beat hard games without trainers or cheat codes love this kind of game. It makes them feel like their gaming gods. Real gamers will be bored to tears with this one.

Nothing got my blood pumping, nothing that made me cry out or grit my teeth. I doubt my pulse got above 80bpm!!! I never sweated a single battle or came close to dying. UGHHH!!!

The battles were too easy..even on the hardest setting. I finished the game within 7 hours. More of my money thrown out the window.

Save your money. Play the demo that is downloadable from the official site. Play the demo twice. If you still have a craving...rent the game...then if you still like it...buy the darn thing. I enjoyed this game at first..but after hours 1 and 2 rolled by...I knew this was going to be a stinker.","Some new ideas, not enough meaty game play!",1155686400,7,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

First off, any game with 9,999 levels has got to be some kind of joke.  How can such a thing be possible without becoming a mind-numbing, repetitive grind?  Answer: it cannot.

Not that you have to get that high, but my point is, if you think that many levels is some kind of good thing, you and I have nothing in common, and you might as well stop reading right now.

This is actually one of the very few games I've ever traded in.  I just couldn't see myself ever inserting the disc again after the first few days.  The gameplay is silly, the story is silly, the voice acting is ... well, it's actually decent.  But I don't buy games for the voice acting alone.

The ""innovative"" lift-and-throw feature is interesting the first couple of times, but once you learn how to exploit it all the time, it becomes more of a chore, like something you're being forced to do instead of something fun.  Same with the ludicrous geo-color-nonsense.  Yes, you CAN kill everything on the screen with it, but how is that engaging or immersive?  To me, it just makes everything ridiculously simple, and it gets old fast.

And the bit about leveling up items?  Ugh.  Seriously, I cannot be bothered.  Not fun.

If you like RPGs that have a good story punctuated with truly strategic battles that actually make you think, if you are looking for a challenge and accept that you might actually lose a tough battle, or if you care at all about rules that make some kind of realistic sense, do NOT buy this game.

True, these cables allow you to watch UMDs and play video games on your TV with the PSP as the controller, but it's nothing like what you'd expect it to be...
While UMDs play great on your TV, and display in Full Frame or Widescreen, (depending on the UMDs aspect ratio) video games are displayed in a tiny rectangular box that takes up roughly half of the screen. I played it on my Sylvania 20"" EDTV, and the display size was about 10 inches, 12 at the very most! It was so small, that it was almost impossible to read the text in the game! And what's more, there's no option to stretch the image to fit your screen! (C'mon even my old GameBoy player for the GameCube could do that!!!)

Put simply, these cables are completely useless unless you own a large (32""-51"") TV with component outs, otherwise it's going to be too small to enjoy playing it on the TV.
Sure, you can watch UMDs on your TV with it, but DVDs look better anyway, and you can watch your UMDs on TV with the much cheaper PSP Composite Cable.

At that time, I also owned an Atari 800XL with Ultima III: Exodus and Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar, which are really enchanting RPG, if you don't mind the crude graphics, so I was hoping Hydlide would be another Ultima, but boy was I wrong. Let's get with the music: it's some of the worst video game music I have ever heard! Cheap ripoff of the Indiana Jones theme song which keeps repeating itself over and over every 15 seconds. I never wanted to play this game unless the volume was turned off because the music will get on your nerves in no time flat. This ""music"" (which I refuse to think of as music) sounds like the worst garbage you'd hear from a music box. The graphics are very crude looking, and even for the 8-bit NES capability, it's really horrible (the graphics of Bionic Commando is miles better than this garbage). Heck, even the old Atari 8-bit adapation of the Ultima series looks better. How about playability? Well you have to run in to slimes and other monsters and press the A button to try to destroy them, but more chances than not, you'll end up killed. Often if you stand in the wrong vegetation, or you stand in the cemetary, your hit points drain without even monsters touching you (until you gain enough experience points). Basically in this game, you're supposed to collect all three fairies before you're able to kill the dragon. It took me ten years to finally win the game. That was in 1999, I finally won the game because I was finally able to find that third fairy. I didn't realize I was supposed to kill two wizards at once with the wave spell to get that last fairy. Perhaps the worst of this game is when you want to save it. You need to obtain an unnecessiarly long password and write it down. More chances than not you have written the password incorrectly and you pretty much lost what you accomplished in this horrible game.

Hydlide is now regarded as not only the worst fantasy RPG ever made, but one of the worst ever made for NES. I have no idea what the makers of this game were thinking. Perhaps they were trying to cash in on the Legend of Zelda fad of the time and fell horribly flat.

This game would have been great if one could actually handle the cars. Maybe this is for Pros only. I put the difficulty level on basic and I can still barely win a race.

Other times being told a driver had blown an engine and then a few minutes later this same driver spins out. How is he still driving?

But, I'm aware a large number of people gave it Five Stars, so I'm forced to conclude that they either have some type of superhuman ability to cope with the funky controls, or they're masochists.

I waited literally years to play this game. The promotional videos looked incredible, and the prospect of encountering, and controlling, other Bounty Hunters was enough to make my mouth water. I bought the very first Metroid Prime back for the Game Cube, a game which was hard, but GOOD.  Metroid Prime: Hunters might have been good, if they had bothered to release it for the Wii, a console which is several orders of magnitude more suitable for this style of game.

The controls kill this game. A game should be difficult because of the challenge inherent within the game, not because of the challenge of using the controls. It has four control schemes that I am aware of, and none of them worked for me. Two of them are Left-Handed. It boggles my mind why they didn't design one of the control schemes to switch the Fire and Jump functions. Tapping to Fire just seems much more practical than tapping to jump, albeit at the cost of rapid fire, but they really should have taken all the limitations of the DS into account before they put this game into production. What's worse, they removed the lock-on feature, which is present in every single other Metroid Prime game I have played. Did they honestly think the touch screen aiming was enough to offset the loss? This leaves me to decide between two control schemes, one where Aiming is slow and fickle, and the other where I move like I have an inner ear infection. Plain and simply put, there was no way of establishing a reasonable facsimile of the Metroid Prime controls on the DS handheld, and it should not have been attempted on any game they wanted to actually Sell.

I'll confess, I only made it to the second boss, and it was only because the game itself seems to realize how awkward its control scheme is. The first boss was very forgiving, and I managed to defeat him with mostly just determination and patience. The second boss, however, slowly whittled down my HP with a near constant sweep of lasers. I tried Fickle-Aim control the first few times, and couldn't deal damage fast enough to wipe out the boss. I then used Inner-Ear-Infection, and did a little better damage, but had trouble dodging the lasers. Mind you, these are SLOW lasers.  Dying to them was humiliating, but couldn't be helped.

This is a game that really should have been the first Wii tie-in to the the Metroid Prime series. Nintendo has a weird habit of incorporating whatever new gimmick their latest system advertises, regardless of whether or not it works for the title or the game mechanics.  But, the Wii's manual point and shoot is a far more intuitive approach to First Person Shooters, and I'm surprised it's not implemented more frequently.

Keep in mind, I'm running on Windows Vista. Though, this mouse is said to be compatible with Vista. Mileage may vary.
Cons:
-As other reviewers mention, I've had my mouse stop in the middle of a game But this happens very in frequently. For some reason, I can still click, but the pointer won't move. Unplugging the mouse and replugging the mouse back in fixes instantly. Luckily I have a keyboard with a USB so this is an easy fix for me.
-I've never had this with a mouse before, but my thumb tends to get noticeably sweaty. I believe this may be due to miniscule amounts of heat being released through the lights on the side.
-I can program the lights, but when I restart my computer, they reset. This may be the same for the DPI settings, not sure.

1.0,False,"09 11, 2005",A3SNO7AAYOXQUN,B00008S7XI,Avatar of the Llama,"This game is pathetic.  The gameplay is like any cut-and-paste first-person shooter, and is therefore boring.  The GHOUL-2 engine is a good idea, but the way it was executed was pathetic.  Okay, so you're telling me in real life if you take a slash at someone's face with a pocket knife, you will abruptly take out a 2-inch by 2-inch chunk of flesh and bone from their forehead for no apparent reason?  And that if you fire at a guy's chest with any weapon all you get is a 2-dimensional hole, with absolutely no 3D effect on it, unlike the head and limbs, and only if you shoot it perhaps five or six times with a shotgun it will be blown into a big red slab of what looks like meat, that will disappear in six seconds?  That you can shoot off a guy's leg at the hip with a Micro-Uzi?  That if you do blow a guy's arm or leg off at the shoulder or hip the severed limb mysteriously disappears?  Please.  Other games didn't have this type of gore effect, but that's what makes them superior to this; at least they don't try and fail miserably.  That's what is truly sad: the developer striving to be revolutionary but just ending up with something that pisses you off at the unprofessionalism of it.

  Not only that, but the aiming device sucks.  It's a poor attempt at mimicking the Tom Clancy game dot and sight iccon that increase in diameter signifying the innacurateness of your weapon.  But in this one, it's always crosshairs, and if you stand still and shoot one round with your Micro-Uzi, you can hit an enemy precisely in the head at any range if you aim for them.  How frickin' dumb.  And also, a highly-trained mercenary with experience like a Green beret goes all John Woo-style and uses two handguns at once, or two Micro-Uzis at once.  Okay, the military DOESN'T TEACH ITS TROOPS TO DO THAT CRAP!!!  Realism my arse.

  It's a very long game, but is very, VERY boring.  All the missons are the same: go down a linear path, getting more weapons, shoot people, blast them to pieces.  Even if there is a random scenario engine to create missions for you to do in different enviroments, it's still all the same, only the maps change.

  The voice acting is terrible, the poor and stereotypical plot twists were easily perceptible from miles away, the plot itself was terrible, everything about this game was downright retarded.  Now, normally, I don't care about graphics in the videogame, but the gameplay and plot was so terrible I have the right to complain about them for once.  Simply put, they're horrible.  The character models are blocky and generally lame to look at (which makes you wonder why the heck it has such high system requirements), the enviroments are completely bare and unrealitic, the GHOUL-2 engine was poorly executed (whoever designed that must have been on drugs, so was whoever described it as being ultra-realistic).  There is nothing good about this game.  Nothing at all.  It wasn't fun, it didn't impress me in the slightest, it was the exact opposite of what they advertised it to be, it isn't worth any amount of money greater than $1.00.  Now, if you have very, very low standards, go ahead and buy it, and have fun blowing people's heads off with a shotgun (how original), or blowing their limbs off, or cutting their head, arms, and legs with a combat knife with a few weak swipes and try to mutilate their torso before it blinks into nonexistence, but it gets old real fast, and it makes you wonder why the developer ever gave permission to pass this off for being ""ultra-realistic"".

  And, for yet another attempt at creating a halfway-decent game, the developers decided to put a little stealth meter so you can get the impression that you can sneak around and use some type of strategy.  However, if you crouch and sneak up on someone, they'll hear you because of their super-sensitive ears, turn around, and shoot at you, but if you crawl on your stomach, you can get right up to them, bump into their legs, stand up, and slash the back of their heads, without anyone noticing, even if one of your enemies is standing three feet away with his back to you.  What the heck is with this game and a lack of realism?

Man, I am so mad I paid $50.00 for this piece of crap.  Don't bother, save your money, and go buy a good FPS, like Red Faction, Unreal Tournament, even Postal 2 (as sad as it may be).  A general rule: if a game is going to have a crappy excuse for a plot, then just exclude the plot altogether.  That's what makes Postal 2 superior to this, even though it is a second-string game.","Truly, truly, a terrible game",1126396800,4,,

Installation was pretty straight forward.

However immediately after installation, the aftermarket wiring harness provided to support the 'nitro button' feature caused an overload in the voltage regulator and quite literally burned a hole in the transistor.

At this point, the nitro button turns on the fans, however when disabled causes the fans to shut off entirely and will overheat the console with continued use.

I contacted amazon for support and they replied to me saying that they only fulfilled the order through another seller and if I want to return the ""unopened or original condition game"" I could do so. First off, it's not a damn game - it's a hardware upgrade accessory.

Second - The problem is, since it burned out the voltage regulator on the xbox motherboard, without the wiring harness included with the fans, the xbox console would no longer work at all.

So I can't return the fans, I can't use the xbox without the fans, and it's who knows if that wiring harness will fail or overload the motherboard again in the future - possibly causing a total system failure.

I waited a little bit on Mass effect 3 when it came out for a price drop maybe and let all the bugs and problems to be ironed out. Well it didn't take long for me to hear the rumors of the bad ending and the complaints. I have heard the majority of people give their ""opinion"" on alot of games and I never agreed with them. So when I heard the ending was bad I took it to heart but thought that there couldn't be anything bad enough to ruin this saga........I was so wrong....

I won't ruin the ending, but let me just say that if you heard the ending was bad from a friend or someone and heard all the bad rumors, believe them 100%. All your hopes and dreams for the mass effect trilogy will go up in smoke in the last few minutes of the game. This damage to the ending and the expectations is so great, that you very well may not even sleep at night, lol. Mass effect 3 in my opinion cannot be reviewed without dragging 1 and 2 into the mix. Why? Because unlike some other games, the Mass effect trilogy is based on your choices and the choices that you make carry on. Its a long story that is somewhat molded by your choices. But Bioware didn't seem to take that into consideration near the end of Mass effect 3. I don't care about how great Mass effect 3's graphics are or the special effects. Or even the increased difficulty I longed for. This game ruined Mass Effect 1 and 2 then ultimately offed whatever was left in the franchise.

I am sorry there is no excuse for this Bioware, and I hope listen to your fans. You honestly have lost alot of respect from me and your ability to make a good rpg saga such as Mass effect. Making mass effect 4 while keeping Mass Effect 3's ending the way it is won't fly with me. You lost a customer, and I am not the kind of person who says stuf like that. I am not sure if you were on some bad medication when you wrote the ending or what, but since you refuse to listen to fans, you have now alienated yourself.

I strongly urge anybody interested in purchasing a PS3 to do some research prior to see if they are comfortable with the changes that get made. Sony loves to update the firmware on this thing- sometimes for no other reason than to take away features (or add features that inadvertently brick/kill some consoles). They've spent a ton of time on 'security updates'- while leaving things like some of the most voted for features out.

In recent memory-

* firmware update killed the ""other O/S"" feature. You could install linux and such and use it as a little computer. I am particularly miffed about that one. They claimed it was to patch a hole that was a security concern. Oddly enough - a USB device came out afterwards that allowed pirating of things anyways. If you chose not to update- you cannot play games online, you can't update the BR portion of the unit, etc.

*most models do not have backwards compatibility. Not so much a cost saving measure so much as they want to sell the stuff that would've been backwards compatible as re-releases or through the PS Store.

*newest firmware update kills some USB devices (thumb drives, portable hard drives, etc), unofficial controllers, flight sticks, and more. This was to address the hole that came apparent after they nixed the O/S feature.

I pre-ordered a 60gb hardware bc system, picked it up launch day. Let me say now that Uncharted 1/2 are amazing. Resistance is awesome. There are a ton of really great games out there, and as a Blu-Ray player- it is one of the best. That being said- as a gaming machine, the company's policies are absolutely terrible and are not in favor of the buyer at all (and seem to be getting worse). Not a fanboy here- not a fanboy rant. I want to keep loving the system- but Sony makes it so terribly hard. It's a shame- play Wipeout and tell me that there's a better futuristic racer out there right now!

And the kicker. If one breaks- it's $150 + shipping to have it repaired. I've been through a few Xbox 360's (though the new model is rock solid). I am not out a penny with those RROD's. I lost a PS3- and it cost awful close to $200 to get fixed. It died again within 8 months (with proper orientation and ventilation). I got that repair for free (though I had to cover shipping). As it stands now, I am not hooking that unit to the internet and losing any more functions/features.

So- long story short- if you want to watch BR's- it's amazing. If you don't care about functions/features being removed down the road, then go for it. If you don't care about repair costs (or are prepared to fight on the phone- they cut freebies sometimes for people who have had to get multiple repairs), then it's not a bad system. I just strongly urge anybody considering a purchase to take some time and research the pros/cons of the units and see if any of the things (or other issues) are deal breakers.",Strongly reccomend you research first,1285286400,60,,

Story: 3/10

It's not 'gasp, it's Dong Zhuo!' ugly, but it's disappointing.
Graphics: 5/10

At least the sound effects do all the right stealing. The movies sound pretty good, and the game sounds fair. Music and in-game sound-effect volume can be altered independently, but the ambiance lacks a certain polish that I expected from the movies the game is based off.
Sound: 6/10

While the music is indeed stolen from the movies, what shows in the game is toned down background material. While&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Third-Age/dp/B0002IQD1U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings The Third Age</a>&nbsp;may not have been the most innovative RPG, at least it sounded and looked nice throughout.
Music: 5.8/10

This is repetitive action requiring complex combos for unimpressive-looking moves, along a narrow path that offers none of the free exploration of the wide, impressive lands of the movies. Your ability to upgrade your character is based on how skilled (lucky) you are in the level, because you can't replay and this means that if you have a bad run, your only option is to reset the game and load all over again. None of the skills really seem to change gameplay that much, as an RPG this game falls flat on its face and as a hack-and-slash it makes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dynasty-Warriors-4/dp/B00007KQE9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dynasty Warriors 4</a>&nbsp;look great (it's not). The local co-op consists of the middle six levels where a friend can follow you along the narrow, short levels, but isn't nearly as easy to get into as good co-op games where you can generally have a friend help from the start.
Gameplay: 4/10

You don't even get the option to play co-op until after you've already spent at least a half-hour beating the first two levels, and then you have to save and quit to the main menu to discover that levels can't be repeated. What? You didn't have a lucky run with Gimli and you're too short for that one minimally helpful upgrade? Start all over. The fact that the first two levels can only be played with one fixed character and all but one of the rest are locked to Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli don't help. There are extras you automatically unlock by progressing through the missions, but unlike The Third Age there's little good organization or sense of true satisfaction.
Replayability: 1/10

With the large number of five-star reviews, I had high expectations, and perhaps that was part of the problem. Everything it tries to do has already been done better elsewhere, and while I'm not going to say this game was horrible, it was short and lackluster - barring getting stuck on a level, you can finish in one sitting of just a few hours (though boring load times and unskippable cutscenes don't help). If you want a good Lord of the Rings RPG,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Third-Age/dp/B0002IQD1U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings The Third Age</a>&nbsp;is superb compared to this.

When the sequel came out, lets just say, it didn't come out to be as great. Well....actually...it wasn't great at all. This was probably the most horrible idea Konami and Kallisto came up with. The graphics are lame. It's like playing a PlayStation game on the Dreamcast. The controls are okay, but when you attack your opponent, it will take more than just two or three hits to kill your enemy. The AI is barely responsive! The zombies only give you a single hit, leaving you a chance to hit them even more until they can't take it anymore and give you a fatality and heck, it doesn't even kill you until you have a short amount of energy. Audio-wise, the voice acting is pretty cool. The main character can really put a lot of effort in his voice while he's telling the story. And if you guys out there are hardcore Rob Zombie fans (I hate Rob Zombie), you'll like the music they put in here. Mostly, some people would just buy games for their soundtracks. I'd say, don't just buy the game just because of the music. Buy it for its superb play controls, detailed graphics, and ultimate replay value. Obviously, Nightmare Creatures II is seriously lacking these features. Nightmare Creatures II is just another letdown exposed on the PlayStation and Dreamcast. Some people found this game very interesting, but I didn't. In my opinion, games this bad deserve a one night rental. If you're in need for a great survival horror game for the Dreamcast, get Resident Evil 2, Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, Resident Evil Code Veronica, or Alone In The Dark: The New Nightmare.

I have leveled 2 characters to 50 and can honestly say without reservation that this game is a massive disappointment to me.

If you enjoy PVP this is NOT your game, the game is poorly designed for open world PVP. The factions are segregated on the world maps and rarely overlap. The battlegrounds are fun, the first 20 times you play them, but after that good luck maintaining your sanity. Huttball is about all you will see if you roll empire as there is a MASSIVE faction imbalance in favor of the empire on nearly if not all servers. Ilum, the PVP world for level 50s is a joke of the highest order. Bioware should've stated the truth from launch... Star Wars the Old Republic is not a PVP MMO.

As for the game, it runs choppy whenever you are near other players, even on a high spec rig like mine (I run 2 6850s in crossfire). The game engine is abhorrent and may be the reason they segregate factions in the first place as it keeps players from discovering this until later on.

I'm not saying this to say we're Game Gods. I'm saying this because we were in utter shock that the game is so short, so boring, and so completely unlike the previous games that we loved. I can't even imagine how the company that created the previous, fantastic Gauntlet games could be responsible for this release. Maybe they lost their good programmers and were under contract to release a new Gauntlet by X date, so they had their newbie coders kick this out? I am just horrified at how poor this game was.

First, you get a choice of four charaters, of course - the elf, warrior, mage or valkyrie. However, you don't get to choose their color! I know it's a small thing, but I was ticked at that to start.

Your character has 3 main attacks plus 1 long-range attack - so the elf gets 3 sword swings plus his bow attack. In addition, there are combo attacks and d-button super attacks that you can pay to unlock over time. You then move from map to map, bashing away at enemies, killing the enemy generators and finding keys for doors. That part of the gameplay is similar to previous games. You can't shoot your friends in the back of the head, which my fellow gamers appreciated greatly. I was notorious for standing in the back area as the elf and just letting the arrows fly.

Really, the huge issue is the game's shortness. If it was 3-4 times longer, at least, it would seem perhaps worth playing. But I really found its entire layout much less interesting than the previous Gauntlet. In the previous one, you had a central area from where you could go out to various worlds, each with its own theme, going back and forth as you wished. In this one it's just a straight line, and while there are some thematic elements, it came across as a dungeon crawl that just plodding on for a few hours, then stopped.

Also, in the previous games, when you got character upgrades it was really exciting. You clearly saw the change and it was something fun to pay attention to. In this one when you get weapon and armor upgrades, you can barely tell. We would even stare at our characters before doing an upgrade, and it was hard to see anything had even changed.

The vocals really didn't impress me much. Part of the problem is that they would tell you ""elf needs food"" when the elf still had a ways to go - but then they would tell you ""starving"" and ""has died"" right on top of each other. So you were always being harassed about needing food, but never when you really needed to know. Also, with death being able to be slain with a mana blast, you pretty much were able to kill off death in .2 seconds any time you opened a chest. So Death was barely announcing his presence before he vanished again.

The graphics were good. There were many spots that looked walkable that you were magically blocked from going into, which was a bit annoying. If an area isn't open, don't put a wide open door pointing to it :)

What they ended up doing to accomplish this was take every negative factor from all past role playing games, and jam them all into one horrifically bad excuse for a video game.

The dialogue in this game is completely irrelevant.  There is no reason to pay attention to any of it, anything you need to know you'll figure out on your own.  There is hours of spoken dialogue in this game, none of it bears any purpose.  Characters speak, but they say absolutely nothing.  Conversations that go like ""How are you?""  ""I am ok.""  ""You look cold""  ""I am cold""  ""Thank you"".  After that waste of programming code, you're allowed to continue on.  The spoken dialogue is also done by what have to be the most unproffesional voice actors I've ever heard.  They either over emphasize the idiotic personality of the character, or don't give the character any personality at all.  You will speed click through all the dialogue in the game, that is if you end up wasting your money on this game.

The game is just one long straight line with random encounters along the way.  I spoiled the entire game for you right there.  You run forward, fight some monsters, and win the game.  That's not worth sixty dollars in my opinion.  Ubisoft deliberately released a game after putting absolutely no effort into making it interesting.  You get one town of irrelevant and annoying dialogue, where the high point is running around collecting tickets.  Final Fantasy X was just a game where you run forward throughout the whole thing, but at least they realized that they had to make their characters slightly interesting.

The battle system is slow, and makes the turn based system of battle look even more ridiculous than ever.  It's like the battle system from koudelka, you're on your own grid and use ranged attacks against your enemy who's on their own grid.  This is the most irratating system for turn based battle in my opinion.  Ubisoft will probably explain that they thought long and hard about it and decided to make a turn based battle system that let's you use strategy to defeat your enemies, they just forgot to plan the actual enemies in the game around this concept.  What I mean by that is you fight enemies who can attack every square on your grid, and you gain abilities where you can attack every square on their grid.  Chess it is not, more like turn based Rochambeau.

The menus in the game are very time consuming, and were obviously just thrown together and abandoned.  You make a weapon in one menu, quit that menu, open a different menu, equip the weapon.  You buy a skill in one menu, quit that menu, open a different menu, learn the skill, back out of that part of the menu, equip the skill.  Ubisoft apparently thinks that when you make a decision to own something, it's for the sheer joy of knowing that it's not being used as a part of your repitoire.

One are where they obviously invested (wasted) alot of effort was in making neat little companions, which they call ""golems"".  There's alot of them in this game, so you can have fun making them and looking at them.  You'll only use one at a time, so the other sixty will have to wait in limbo.  Each one is designed to be unique and speak one of two styles of japanese, slow and menacing or high and hyper.  They even wrote biographies for each golem, they explain their uniquely irrelevant details.

And why shouldnt it? Diablo 2 was a great game and still manages to hook players in for being more than 10 years old which is a testament to how good it was.

Diablo 3, however, was a letdown and failure in every possible way, and a slap in the face to fans who have been waiting so long for the third installment.

First problem, was of course the launch. Blizzard knew they had a massive amount of people preordering the game. Beta and stress tests were run, so theres no excuse for what happened when the game went live. Servers crashed, and people trying to log in were essentially blocked from playing a game they paid for. The online only play method proved to be a horrible idea that only punished customers and became apparent the first day. Instead of preparing for the launch and overcompensating for the huge demand, Blizzard chose to go the bare minimum route to see just how few servers they could get away with to run the game. It took about a week for the log in issues to be resolved, but even after that, the people that could finally log in were greeted with horrible server lag and pings that were in the 250-700 range which meant huge delays with what was happening on screen, and even more trouble for people who attempted to play hardcore mode. The game would freeze up for a few seconds, and you would find your character permanently dead after the server re-synced.

To this day the game is still unoptimized and people with higher end systems are still experiencing bugs such as the infamous stuttering problem which was present from the beta and never fixed even though Blizzard said it would be for the release.

Blizzard famously adopted the ""it will be released when its finished"" viewpoint on the game. However, seems they didn't stick with that for long since the game was released unfinished, buggy, and missing many features, biggest of all being arena combat and PVP. It was rushed to market to appease stockholders and report financial gains plain and simple.

The graphics are a mixed bag. On one side, they don't look terrible and the effects look nice. On the other, the atmosphere is not Diablo at all. Instead of a dark and dreary world, they chose to make it colorful and cartoonish to an extent to mirror World of Warcraft.

Gameplay wise, the game was somewhat fun, but only on the first playthrough. Combat and skills work nicely together, yet when you finish the game on normal mode, theres not much more reason to play. The game just gets a little bit harder on the next difficulty, but the story and quests remain exactly the same.

Acts 1 and 2 were somewhat interesting and varied. However, Act 3, and to a higher extent Act 4, seem very rushed and bland. The storyline for the game was also pretty boring and uninspired and you can tell the people that did the original games had nothing to do with this one.

Inferno mode which is the highest difficulty, just turns into grinding mobs to farm high end gear. The drops in Diablo 3 have become extremely rare to get anything good, which means you need to go to the auction house to get halfway decent items. However, this makes the game just feel like pay to win which essentially it is with the addition of the real money auction house. The auction house has also made gold practically worthless. Botters and farmers have driven prices in the auction house to insane levels where it costs 500 million gold or more for decent items, and the value of gold is dropping daily. Blizzard even patched the game to make equipment repairs cost more money so you're constantly fixing your gear and not making any money to buy anything.

For $60, there just isn't any value in this game. Its no longer a Diablo game, and I guess that should have been clear since most of the team that made the first two games have left Blizzard. If it didn't have Diablo in the title and was named something else, it wouldnt have sold anywhere as well as it did. They should have just named this World of Warcraft: Heroes or something like that because its exactly what this game is. A WoW spinoff and cash-in attempt by Blizzard to exploit their fans for money.

This is simply pathetic on behalf of Electronic Arts. They're selling a product with absolutely no forward notice to an enormous percentage of Xbox 360 owners have no way of using this product.

I thought this game would be similar to the sims 1 and the sims bustin out. Instead they tried to be ""hip"" and ruined the whole game. The best thing about the game is that it is really short and the black eyed peas did the music.

The loading time is very long,in fact I bet if you added up all the loading time, its longer than the actual gameplay. You carry your furniture around with you and the furniture is different in every district which I thought was annoying.

Every district is different. There are the goths, the artsy people etc.. When you go to different districts you get a job. I thought this was going to be cool because in Bustin' out you didn't get to see your sim at work. But it all turns out to be boring. You press different buttons on your controller in different combinations to perform your tasks. Some of the jobs were cute and funny (like training pet ferrets) but the button pressing was very boring and repetitive. They missed a perfectly good opportunity to be inventive.

Its all about climbing the social ladder, impressing people, and proving how cool you are etc Every night each district has a party at a club but you have to have the right reputation to get into the club and wear the right clothes or you won't be able to get past the bouncer. So for example, when you come back from the artsy district don't think you are going to get into the hip hop club dressed like andy warhol.

Changing your outfit when you go to different districts was very annoying. If you wear the wrong clothes in the wrong district the natives will insult your clothes. But if you have a great rep they will start dressing like you. I thought the whole point of having the different clothes, hairstyles, etc was to be able to make your sim look the way YOU wanted?

At the club a dude dressed like a Run DMC reject will teach you a power social move that will help you impress others and get a reputation faster. But the characters all are exagerated stereotypes with stupid names. The game tries really hard to be funny but its just corny.

 Unlike in the other games your character couldn't even get married and have kids which I thought was lame. There were no real goals in the game, its all about fitting in and impressing characters that were irritating. People from different districts don't get along so for example, the goths might want you to pull a prank on the artsies but who cares?

Electronic Arts Says:
""Authorization limits
... you are limited to five authorizations. So what's an authorization? The first time you actually run the game on a machine, we will authorize that machine. If you reach the authorization limit, the game will not run on a new machine. If you make major changes to the computer (switching out multiple pieces of hardware, install a new OS, etc.) you might need to reauthorize the machine.""

What they don't mention here is that a ""major change"" to your computer can be quite a bit less than changing out multiple pieces of hardware. In fact, changing a keyboard, mouse, or joystick or any number of USB devices could be regarded as a ""major change"". Upgrading drivers for you sound or video card might be a major change. The rules are not defined and you will not know for sure what may or may not use up an authorization.

So if you use up all of your Authorizations? Electronic Arts says:
""Just give us a call...
If you had a run of bad luck, some hardware failures, a botched OS install, your notebook was stolen, you spilled a coke on your keyboard - you get the idea - and all five of your authorizations have been used up, just give us a call. We'll work with you and provide as many additional authorizations as are appropriate.""

What they fail to mention here is that calling Electronic Arts for technical support is not free. You will be charged 2.50/minute plus any toll charges.

Now consider the idea that you have bought 5 Electronic Arts games over time and one by one they all run out of authorizations. When the authorizations start running out, do you honestly want to call EA every time you make a hardware change to ask them to allow you to play a game you already paid for? What a hassle!

1.  The cars don't feel right.  In Most Wanted, you felt like you were driving a solid car.  But in the game, you somehow feel like you're piloting a soggy balloon that can't reach escape velocity.

2.  The cutscenes and overall plot is filled with such juvenile piffle that you want to hide under the table.  Unfortunately, in the game the dialogue was merged with the same track as the triumphalist orchestral score, so if you turn off the music, you can't hear the dialogue and won't understand the plot.

3.  This game cheats!  You work your heiny off to get the world's fastest production car, a Bugatti Veyron.  Then you lovingly customize it with all the latest bells and whistles.  Then you smugly start a race, knowing that NOBODY can have a faster car than you.  Then, when you're at maximum speed, your AI rivals zoom past you in a much lesser Porsche as though you're standing still.

Yes, the logic of what cars can do what is completely nonsensical in this game.  It doesn't matter what car you're driving.  Even if you're behind the wheel of the ThrustSCC, the computer cars are apparently allowed to do whatever your maximum speed is + 20%.

The analog swing is unchanged, letting you control the power and direction of your shot with a back-and-forward motion on the analog stick.
One of the big new additions to Tiger Woods 2004 is the ""game face"" feature that allows you to create your own pro golfer with a rather painstaking level of detail. This player creation mode lets you define virtually every aspect of your player's appearance. For some idea as to how extensive it is, there are 18 different attributes that can be modified in terms of facial structure alone, not including facial hair, eye color, skin tone, and what your golfer's teeth might look like. Truly, the level of character customization offered by the game face feature is unparalleled.

The one word to summarize this game: BORING.

I bought this a few days ago. There's a reason, I now know, that a 10 month old game is selling for only $20 at a local big box. I hear DA: Origins was great. I never played that. Some reviewers here are reviewing DA 2 not on its own merits but as an inferior comparison to DA: Origins. I am not. I really have no horse in this race. Another reviewer said this is a terrible RPG but a great button masher. I disagree heartily. If you've ever played Diablo, that is a 50 IQ brainless button-mashing experience, but it's also unbelievably fun. This is not that. Although the combat (what little I've seen when not stuck in a dialog screen) is nothing more than idiotic smashing of A, the rest of the game is not an action adventure at all.

I have played only several hours but based on what I've experienced and read elsewhere, that's enough. Yes, I'm reviewing after only a few hours, but I don't want to play anymore. I have been playing RPGs for many, many years now and this is one of the worst impressions I've had. Here are the main problems:

1) Graphics are bad. They are quite dated in comparison to what the 360 is capable of and we've seen elsewhere
2) Terrible city design. The entire city feels like it was auto-generated. The space between buildings is absurdly large (streets you could drive parade floats down side by side) and it makes everything feel extremely artificial. Too many squares and rectangles and not enough people. It just feels unnatural. They were going for grand, they got weird.
3) Way too much talking between characters. I have spent much more time in dialog than in actual combat or doing anything in the game. The ""game"" is way too much chatter and unfortunately since it's all voiced it cannot be skipped. Voiced is fine--but only if I can skip it to speed things up.
4) You know something is wrong when you level up and can't be bothered to go into the menu to choose stats. I think the moment I hit ""auto-level up"" I realized I didn't care at all anymore and I wouldn't be playing again. I never cared, nor felt it mattered.
5) I've never had a game for only a few days and when bored (this evening) struggling to find something else to do so I wouldn't have to go down and force myself to like it.

I actually read some (not enough) reviews of this before purchase. I was expecting a dumbed down RPG with a rich story and fast-paced action, but it isn't. It's slow and uninspiring.

The game was severely rushed, and there is a reason why the lead designer of Dragon Age Origins left the company during design of this. He probably just couldn't stomach it. I know I couldn't.",I am not am embittered DA Origins fan,1328486400,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",

Still, people are buying these games up, cherishing them as if they were masterpieces. People did it with Final Fantasy VII, the worst game in the series (and my personal most-hated game of all time), and guess what? They managed to do it with this entry in the series, too. Well, what're we waiting for? Let's ditch the semantics, roll up our sleeves, and get ready to send hate mail as we take a closer look into the world (hah!) of Final Fantasy XIII.

--STORY--
I honestly thought that, above all else, a game company that focuses heavily on its story and character development would have at LEAST gotten this right. To make a painful story as short and conceivable as possible, long ago, there were ancient godlike creatures called the Fal 'Cie who, for reasons that make absolutely no sense whatsoever, randomly select people in the world of Gran Pulse to become l'Cie, and with it, they receive brands and are given a Focus. These people are never told their Focus at any point, and the only hint they are given is a faint, hazy visual image in their minds of what to do. Yeah, that narrows it down, right? If they are unable to complete their Focus (which seems likely, seeing as it can range anywhere between something crucial or something irrevocably stupid and nobody would ever guess the difference), they become hideous, deformed monsters. If they succeed, they become solid crystal and are granted eternal life...as a crystal that can't do anything with it. So, at some point, people got sick of the stupid games (what a coincidence!) and fled Gran Pulse to the world of Cocoon, only to realize that people were still given brands and Focuses, meaning their entire plan of fleeing from the ""wrath"" of these creatures was utterly pointless (like deciding your neighborhood is too dangerous, so you move to the western part of Detroit). The entire time, the ""heroes"" of the story (if you can call them that) are so determined to complete their Focus and free themselves from this curse. In fact, for more than 92% of the game, all they ever do is stand around and talk about it. The story is stagnated, the characters are predictably amateur and forgettable at best, and you never truly feel like you have any idea as to what is going on in with anything. This game does the best job of completely and absolutely isolating the player from anything even remotely related to...well, everything in the game. It's annoying, it's lazy storytelling, and there are absolutely no twists or turns that leave you wanting more. And, at some point in the story (I won't reveal which part, because no matter what I say, you're probably going to play this game at some point and find out), the plot--in its entirety--collapses in on itself. Good luck getting emotionally invested in anything as the game does its best to just leave you in the dust as it marches forward.

--GAMEPLAY--
This is the most infuriating part of the game, and I'm sure many seeing this review have heard it time and again. This game is nothing but a metaphorical--and literal--hallway. Yup. A hallway. What does that mean? Easy enough. You walk through a long stretch of land, fight a bunch of monsters, watch a cutscene, save your game, keep walking forward, fight some more monsters, watch a cutscene, walk forward, save, then fight a boss. Rinse and repeat. Bam. I just told you everything you need to expect with everything about Final Fantasy XIII. You think it's just the story and the maps that are hallways? Nope. The Crystarium, the new leveling-up system introduced in this game, is a direct slap in the face to literally every other leveling system ever devised in any game at all. It tries to give you the illusion of choice, but when you stop and analyze exactly what's going on, the game is telling you that you can only increase your stats up to this point before having to stop. You're kidding, right? I don't think it's any news to anybody at this point, but the whole idea of overpowering my opponent--especially Bosses--is one of the MAIN reasons I playu JRPG's, where you can experience the difference in power between the playable characters and the enemies they face, which makes you feel like all that you achieved was fruitful and meaningful. This? It allows you to level up your characters, sure, but only in accordance with how strong it wants you to be at that point in the story. No matter how much time you spend grinding CP to reach that next level, you'll still only be able to increase your power to make it so that you're JUST strong enough to defeat the next Boss in the story.

Not only that, but combat has become a boring chore, too. Now, instead of controlling all characters and giving them individual actions, you can only control one character at a time during combat, and the other two just sort of...do their own thing. You can set each member of your party with a Paradigm (basically a set of skills in accordance with what type of attacks and spells you want them to have) in order to add a small (more like microscopic) dose of ""flavor"" to fighting enemies. But even still, this won't help you at any point in the game. In fact, the battle system and the layout of the given enemies actually PUNISHES you for experimenting with your characters and their individual combat skills. If you're about to fight a Boss, and your characters don't have these specific Paradigms already learned and assigned to them before you even THINK about engaging the enemy, you're doomed from the start. Until you grow to a reasonable level of power, and only when you're fighting enemies that are clearly weaker than you, you won't be allowed to truly experiment and see what fits you best. And even when you get that chance, it's pointless to even try. There's nothing around you at that point in the game you can honestly test your formulas on.

Some of you are probably asking, ""Well, what about Summons?"" Oh, they're here. Regrettably. Each character gets one Summon they can use in battle, but remember: you can only control one member at a time, and like I stated before, there's no way to tell the other characters specific actions, so you can't get them to use their Summons, either, which instantly renders five out of the six possible Summons in the game completely useless. Not only that, but they're pathetic in terms of dealing damage. The only real solace that comes with using these wastes of space is when you activate their final attack, which then allows you to go back into battle with your two other characters, only now, everybody's at full health and ready for more action. As if you REALLY wanted that.

--PRESENTATION--
There is absolutely nothing here to amaze you. Nothing whatsoever. The game is the literal definition of linear, the combat is broken, messy, and just unplayable as a whole, leveling up is no longer rewarding or satisfying, and every single map--excluding ONE--is nothing but an extended hallway with a predictable pattern of sequences. There are no towns, no real dungeons, no sense of exploration. And that, alone, is the bane of any game, especially an RPG. I want to explore and see new things, and I want my effort and hard work to be rightfully rewarded when I put the time in to do it. It's almost like this game was going to be a movie--a very unsatisfying, confusing-as-sin movie. But somewhere down the line, they decided to make it a game instead. It doesn't feel like a game. It doesn't even look like one.

--SOUNDTRACK--
It's no surprise that the Final Fantasy series has had some insane quality with its soundtracks, and FF13 is no different. Still, while there are some very memorable and epic songs, most of the others are bland and easily forgettable. There's not really much else to say about it, seeing as that should be enough to tell you what to expect.

--OVERALL RATING: 2/10--
I waited half a decade for this. WE waited half a decade. For THIS. This atrocity, this utter failure, this terrible mistake brought forth by the hands of mankind...It honestly makes me sick to my stomach to even think about this game. Fans of the series were greeted with so much advertising revenue (screenshots, beta music tracks, etc.) of this way back when it was first announced and onward, but who would've thought that all of that hype--all of that excitement--would be wasted and rendered pointless? Now you know how I felt when I played Final Fantasy VII. And now, seeing as you're probably at home playing this game right now, you have chosen to relive those painful, dreadful memories.

Not to mention, most of them were lackluster. I figured they would spend more time fine-tuning, and adding features that would make the wait worthwhile. That didn't happen.

I'm a racing fan, and have owned everything from the original Gran Turismo to PGR. I know some fanatics cherish their simulation racers, and others prefer the strictly arcade style, but I enjoy whatever delivers the most fun. The first couple races definitely reminded me quite a bit of PGR. The ease of attacking hairpins, and weaving in and out AI lines in order to come out ahead. The game had potential, but that quickly diminished into manifestations of irritation and frustration.

Pros:
- Graphics - quite honestly some of the best I have seen on a next-gen system. The way time forces the changes in lighting throughout the duration of the race, and how that affects everything from your instrument panel, to the lights gleaming off your dashboard from the car behind you. Some weird looking polygonal rendering does occur at times especially with heavy light hitting the windshield, but that doesn't take away from the breathtaking visual stimulation before you.

- It doesn't take an experienced gamer to have fun and win matches.

- Quick load times.

Cons:
- Car selection limited to European manufacturers.

- As of now; little to no online. I have tried playing since release and the servers are always undergoing maintenance... They have stated prior to release that their intention is for people to focus on Clubs and forming social interactions, not the single player, so.. the game is utterly useless then? Even Destiny manages to keep their servers online despite delayed launch, and plenty of bugs plaguing their user base. I can't even connect to Drive Club.

- The AI.. is horrid. I mean I have never experienced such performance from the opponent base. People have mentioned this already, they have established driving lines and will not redirect. Instead, they will ram your car and cause you to slide, and land firmly in a patch of dirt/grass (best case), or hit the wall, usually it's the latter. By the way, when this happens you're slapped with a collision penalty and might as well leave your car and push it, because it makes as much impact as applying the pedal. You get spun by the AI and hit a patch of dirt clipping a corner? No problem, here's a penalty for cutting a corner. Good luck restarting your race repeatedly because of this. It's by far the most annoying attribute I have ever experienced in a racing game.

- No customization. The absence of tuning is all too apparent, and what racer nowadays excludes what has become a staple for this genre.

Yet another excellent game that has been given the kiss of death by EA and their moronic, customer hurting DRM scheme.

In case you've not been keeping score, Securom 7x is a DRM (Digital Rights Management) scheme that installs with the game. Allegedly it is intended to prevent illegal copying of the game, or piracy. In actuality, it does not in fact prevent piracy at all. As proof, take a look at Spore, which was pirated and readily available for download from torrent sites the day after its release!

What Securom 7x actually does is pretty creepy:

1. Securom installs on your computer at a higher than administrator level (ring zero) meaning it is virtually impossible to uninstall without jumping through hoops. It is literally malignant virus hard to uninstall, and I know quite well; I made the mistake of installing it on my computer when I bought Mass Effect some time ago.

2. Securom 7x is potentially a data mining tool. Why else would it install with both game demos and Steam products? The steam versions of Crysis Warhead (also a Securom 7x game) contains Securom, despite the fact that Steam, by definition, is a DRM scheme that is sufficient to prevent piracy adequately by itself. Clearly the purpose extends further than simply trying to curb piracy. There is an even darker side to this; the same folks who can and will crack game are most certainly going to harness the Securom 7x back door to take control of computers with it installed. So basically, even if you do trust EA not to use Securom to track your movements and activities, you are still vulnerable to the same pirates that Securom is allegedly designed to curtail. They can and will use this security vulnerability to get access to infected computers. It will happen if it already hasn't.

3. Limited activations. Securom 7x has another purpose: controlling when, and how many times you can install your game. Changing computer hardware can burn an installation. Something as simple changing a hard drive can cause you to lose an installation. I don't care if EA gives us 3,5,10, or 100 activations, as long as they are selling a renal instead of the actual game, this reviewer will PASS.

4. Changing the culture of PC gaming from one of ""Buy game = Own game"" to ""Rent game. Pay for more activations. Pay for endless tech support to help you with DRM related failures. Pay for more activations again. Pay for each minute of game play. Pay for a EA Game license. Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay!""

To those of you who are going to try and hack apart my character by arguing that I am a pirate, or that I don't really buy any games, let me say this: If I was a pirate, I would already be playing this game.

Unless they get rid of the mind numbingly stupid and frighteningly dangerous DRM garbage that comes with it. I am a gamer at heart and I own hundreds of PC games which I have always paid for. I respect gaming and the gaming community, and feel obligated to stand up against creepy corporate greed.

Skinomi I have to say that you have one of the most difficult skin protectors to install. I got mine for the New 3DS XL "" Majora's Mask Limited Edition"" and it didn't fit quire right. In top of being difficult, the cuts are wrong. You miss a noticeable cut on the top left when face is close, Your inside skin cover the IR eye sensor of the New 3DS XL, The edges of the face over lap with the other side of the skin and there is no way it could be done right even tho I tried and I'm very good at it. I hope this protector of yours doesn't mess up my Majora's Mask 3DS since is extremely limited! This is the second time I've bought a skin from you and it was wrong too which was for my iPhone 6 Plus. Then you dare to send me a message saying that your cuts are precise and done right...its not. After 10 mins of being installed it bubble up. In this case, is quite difficult to just spray water in the device. I did use some and very little amount because I don't want to have water or solution damage. I'm going to wait 24 hours to see if bubbles goes away but it was another disappointment. LifeTime Warranty doesn't take away the fact I have to do it over if you send me another one. I will keep my post updated and will post pictures.

Everything that made the first 3 games great has been changed.  You no longer can take your time and sneak up on enemies.  You are forced to rush with arbitrary time limits.  Now, true, there were time limits in some of the levels of the previous 3, but, in this game, EVERY level must be beaten at a certain time to complete all objectives.

  You can progress without completing all objectives, though... which is dumb, cuz you would immediately be sent back to the last checkpoint in the previous 3 once you messed up one objective.  And the time limits are much harder than even the second filter game.  I hate how this game stresses me out.

  Syphon Filter 4 took a great series that was unique and made it bad.  Goldeneye and Perfect Dark are also much like the first three Syphon Filters.  This game is horrible compared to any of these games.

  Finally, the constant respawning of enemies is dumb too.  I don't want to fight infinite guys.  I want to clear the level out at my own pace and, at some point, REACH AN END.  You can't do that in this game.

New stuff:
There's a target system when you are in close combat which was easy to pick up even though there was no tutorial. There will be a crosshair on the enemy and you have to move your crosshair to match his and click (or shoot). You will then counter his move or make your strike.

Weapons: You have 2 weapons slots. One for a large calibre weapon and one for a sidearm. It doesn't tell you that you can carry 2 sidearms and by pressing ""2"" a second time, you can use the alt pistol you picked up along the way.

Movement: Every time you are near a wall or cover, the popup to let you know you can take cover shows up in the center of the screen and is more annoying than helpfull.

Graphics:
Not cutting edge but not bad by far. I had no problems with getting stuck in the environments, no clipping problems and the characters didn't give you that, ""I've killed the same guy 100 times!"" feel.
Environments looked well designed and it was pretty easy to find where you needed to go to complete the missions.

THE BAD:
There is NO save system. I played up until the first sniper scenario in the opera house and had to quit to rest. I pressed escape and there was no choice to save! Even though along the way, after multiple cut scenes loading new areas and ""objectives met"", it didn't save my progress. It said since I wasn't using Windows LIVE it won't save my progress!!??

Unbelievable.  You wonder how that could happen.  You gotta verify two things: that it sounds ok through the earphones, and sounds ok from the mic, and there's no variation at all in the systems that it is being used with, so it's the simplest thing to test imaginable.

Like others have said, very comfortable headphones, nice sound, but useless mic.  And personally I'm not swallowing the ""the good news is it's not the mic"" nonsense.  All it takes is one look at the mic to know that it's poorly designed.  The mic doesn't point at your mouth!  So it's recording from your ear! So it would have to have a omni-directional pickup pattern, which means that even if the mic were decent, and boosted enough to hear, you'd still be getting a ton of ambient noise.  It would probably pick up noise from behind you better than your actual voice ironically, that's of course if it actually worked at all.  Ugh, what a disappointment.  Nice job Polk.

Many of the games have emulation issues-the most common being flaky control and a distorted aspect ratio (many of the games get stretched to fill more of the PSP's wide screen).  But the real problem is just that these games haven't held up well.  I got some enjoyment out of Rampage 15, 20 years ago, but it's incredibly repetitive by today's standards.  You've seen everything there is to see within the first minute or two.  The same is true of most of these games.  Even Gauntlet seems boring 20 years later-I'd rather play the more recent update to the series-or better still something like Diablo and its clones.

The Mortal Kombat games at least LOOK pretty good, but lack any kind of extras you'd normally associate with a home game.  They don't even include move lists.  (And that's aside from the fact they didn't play as well as the Street Fighter games to begin with, and the passage of time has only made them feel staler.)

If you're a huge fan of these games already, and don't mind some emulation issues, you'll probably enjoy this disc.

The bay you place your system in is shallow, and it does not take much jarring to have your PS4 take a dive from the stand. What's worse for me personally is that the charging bays prohibit you from seeing the lights and knowing if the charge is complete. That could have been easily corrected by putting a transparent piece of plastic around the charging bays... it would have been lit up by the controllers. As it is you have no idea whether or not the charge is complete. The base also ""boasts"" additional cooling fans, but these are all but useless. They are exposed to a part of the system that provides little access for the fans to pull out heat. To make them even less useless the fans have hardly any clearance from the location you rest the stand on thereby providing nearly no escape for any heat in the first place.

Well, I'd love to explain to you all the problems I had with this game, but unfortunately, I can only use a certain number of words for this review, so I'll cover all the main problems I had with it.
First and most important is the ending.  The ending was depressing for anyone who's ever played a Zelda title.  Changing the ending alone would have been enough to make the game about 5 times better.  I won't tell you what it was, only that it was TERRIBLE.
Secondly, the Gameplay barely existed.  I found that half the game was spent doing NOTHING.  I just set up my sail and waited for five minutes while the game propelled me to my next destination.  The other half of the game was spent fighting battles and solving puzzles that were so easy, no five-year-old would fail at them.
Storyline-wise, this game is a flop.  It contains only one realistically-behaving character; Ganon.  The rest of the characters are the product of plot holes, and are moved along BY the story, not the other way around.  Big problem in any game these days.
The graphics annoyed me, but only because the character models were very ugly.  And as for the music, it just seemed incongrous very often.
Plus, none of the characters talk!  On the GCN!  That's laziness to the umteenth power from a game-design perspective.
Still, although I thought this game was a piece of garbage, there are those who found it fun, so I would be being unfair to say it is IMPOSSIBLE to like this game, despite all the huge, gaping flaws and mindless tedium it showcases.  To make everyone happy, I reccomend that you rent this game once to see whether or not you'll like it.

Here were some of my biggest issues with the system (and by that I mean the console, Microsoft, and gaming companies):

1. I'm required to be on the Internet.
So basically I have to buy the system and have internet for it to even work. The original I could play even if the internet went down, now not so much.

2. Required to have Xbox Live.
Now this isn't a requirement for all games but a lot being manufactured these days require you to have Xbox Live to do anything more than the tutorials. Xbox Live $60 a year plus, $60 for a games = $120 to really get anything out of it.

3. Updates and game installation.
Seemed like any time I turned the system for the first week I would wait 15min for the it to update. On top of that I had to install the game on my system which took around 30 min. Plus once the game was installed and I find out I didn't like it, sorry no returns since the games can only be installed once.

1.0,False,"05 20, 2014",A21LSWE2W9O9DQ,B0006B0O9U,Slick,"I have played TONS of Mario games. I got a Wii for X-mas in 2012, and a 3DS in December 2013. I never had the original DS, but the 3DS can play DS and DSi games. I've heard great reviews for this AND the original N64 game. Super Mario 64 is often said to be the best Mario game ever. I played the N64 version first on the Wii. The game was somewhat fun, but the horrible controls and the terrible movement of Mario & camera angles made it 1-star. I heard this game had new stars & characters, so I got it. Plus, because it was a game released in 2004, (ten yrs. old), the camera angles and graphics would be better than the game on the N64 (1996). I was wrong by a long shot.
  First, the ""New characters"" thing is stupid. It's a pain in the butt to have to switch from Yoshi to Mario and back to Yoshi for some stars. The ""pick up a Wario hat and you're now Wario!"" thing is lame because make one error, and you gotta start the whole level over again. I did not like this new feature at all. It's one area that the horrible N64 version is superior to the terrible DS version.
  Second, the graphics are a nightmare. The graphics look worse than on an N64! They bother my eyes, and you'll keep dying because you can't see where your going or where the goomba chasing you went! Three seconds later, he hits you and you have to grab a coin to restore it. Easy, right? Wait! I can't tell where the coin is! OK, I'm exaggerating a bit, but not by too much.
  Third, the controls are very confusing. The ""Touch screen"" thing is a fail. You have to drag your finger while looking at both screens at the same time!  If you are playing this on the old DS, your other option is the control pad. I never did good with control pads except on the Wii, so they might not be too bad. I'm glad I had a 3DS with the thumb-stick which is OK, I guess. But why ""B"" to jump? ""A"" is a much better fit for this! They used ""Y"" for sprint(good) and ""A"" for punch(bad). The controls overall are a complete mess that is not necessary.
  Third, the sound is horrible. That annoying music! Poor sound quality! That stupid sound Mario makes when he punches! These are all in here.

Overall, Super Mario 64 DS is on par with Super Mario 64(N64), which both suck. Super Mario 64 is not how 3-D platforming should be done. For the price of 30 US dollars, this is not worth it. Rent it before buying it. It's not worth one cent to me. If you're looking for a 3D Mario game on the go, buy Super Mario 3D Land, with charming graphics, nice music, and good controls & gameplay. If you want a list of Mario games in order, here it is:

Best:

1. Super Mario Galaxy 2 (Wii)
2. Super Paper Mario (Wii)
3. Super Mario Galaxy (Wii)
4. Super Mario 3D Land (3DS)
5. Paper Mario (N64)

Worst:

1. Super Mario 64/Super Mario 64 DS (N64, DS)
2. Super Mario Bros. 2 (NES)
3. Super Mario World  (SNES)
4. Super Mario Bros. 3  (NES)
5. Super Mario Sunshine (GCN)

Overall, for this, buy the far superior Super Mario Galaxy 2.

Wow, I wasn't really expecting this to happen... picked up the tin box special edition from my local gamestop, ran home to install, and get things going.

First few mintues were an immediate disbelief that I may have wasted $70 on the special edition (though the goodies that came with the special edition are kinda neat).

After what seemed like a 25 minute waste of time, and a really poor intro, i finally made it out of vault 101.

I looked, expecting a breath taking surreal post-nuclear war enviornment in brillant detail.

I was so horribly wrong.

While the character models are strong, the rest of the environment looked a tad bit less graphical than STALKER. And STALKER graphics weren't even that impressive.

And on top of it all, after attempting to adjust to the control scheme, it just felt ""lost"" and kinda spread out all over in all sorts of annoying and inconvienent menus.

Even VAT was pretty pathetic, and doesn't add much interest into a game that as if it was a familiuar feeling of something I've allready played in Chernobyl, with less than average animations, graphics, story, etc.

Another problem the game has is that it cant quite seem to choose what it wants to be.... a 1st person shooter, 3rd person shooter, or a RPG. While the idea of the mix is intriguing, it just doesn't work out well in the game, and is poorly implemented.

I don't understand how things could have gone so horribly wrong with this game. More importantly, I have no idea how this game is getting the reviews it's gained, other than maybe the magazines were just desperate for some under-the-table payoff.

Your money would be far better spent on Farcry 2, Dead Space, or STALKER Clear Sky at this point.

Basically, there are pauses in the mouse's operation, lasting anywhere from a fraction of a second (enough to seriously throw off mouse motion), to more than a second, though the latter are more frequent. During this time, the pointer just stops, and when it picks up again, it seems to have applied every mouse movement it received during the pause. The mouse is unusable.

Edit: Mouse is just fine. I had to download legacy Razer drivers, which still had me run the Synapse software, but THAT software doesn't involve logging into the cloud, and once configured, you can close the process and set it to not load on startup, and the mouse still works.

I suppose I would be able to stomach the idea of using some kind of lightweight proprietary software for something that's as specialized as this mouse as an option, but that's not how this works. You MUST use the software, and you MUST create an account with them and log in to Razer's cloud-based configuration system. This is not something anyone should be required to do.

The voice acting didn't have the best voices, and the characters were either so subtly played or over the top that they didn't have the same feel. Locke was an insufferably annoying philosopher, spouting of fortune cookie quotes about you and the island, and providing little real help. Kate and Jack were tolerable, but so ephemeral that the might as well have not been present. No other Lostie was present, and the camp was so small as to hold maybe 20 people, not the 50 that are really cast.

The gameplay consisted of glaringly obvious puzzles and tracking through the jungle for 30 minute stretchs: 5 minutes of walking and 25 minutes of waiting for the black smoke monster to leave. This alternated with 2 minute mazes where your torch or lantern was your essential life bar.

I have been playing Blizzard games since D1 and have been a dedicated fan. I almost strictly play their games... I have had D3 in my mind since shortly after D2, which I thoroughly played and enjoyed for years (even recently). As somebody who probably plays games a little more than they should, D3 was supposed to be my next ""fix"". I liked the idea of something more casual than WoW, and wanted to play D3 for even as long as 5-10 years. I usually stick to one game. Long story short, I'm terribly bored after 3 weeks. I have probably gotten my money worth, but a lot of players intend to play these sort of games for a long, long time. Even Blizzard would never, ever admit that D3 is a game that you should only get a few weeks enjoyment out of and be done. Absolutely not.

D3 simply lacks any depth that D2 had. Everything has been ""refined"" and very simplified. You will never, ever need to make more than 1 of each class (non-hardcore) because nothing is fixed on your character. It sounds all good and well probably to most casual players, but it isn't. They've just taken one of the fun elements out of the game. Every D2 player will tell you starting new characters with new builds was fun and at the very least gave them something to do. Items are boring... everything is too fair and balanced, nothing is extreme. That probably also sounds reasonable, but some of the unbalanced imperfections of D2 were the best part. Instead of having items with say, a 25% on hit to do something, you might have an item with a 2% chance to cause an enemy with millions of HP to ""bleed"" for 200 damage. Woohoo. A D2 item might have a 25% chance to freeze enemies as well as a 25% chance of a Crushing Blow. Some items even gave you other classes abilities. A single item change could completely change the way your character played, they were that significant. The items were all over the place and crazy, but it also added depth to the game. ENTIRE builds could be made around single items in D2. In D3 Set and Unique items are much more rare (yes, more rare and more boring). In D2 I could log on, kill Mephisto, and get probably at the very least a Unique or Set item. In D3 you can literally go over 100 hours of playing without ever finding a Set or Unique item. D3 also doesn't stay true to the true nature of a hack'n'slash. I always imagined that in a hack'n'slash you kill hordes of enemies and collect loot. In D3 (Inferno) each enemy is like a boss and you will die many, many... many times. You will without a doubt find yourself being killed in one hit. Not fun. Other negatives, and this may just be my opinion, are that there is a 4-player limit per game. There is no PVP currently what-so-ever. There is little reason to play with other people. The game gets much harder, people are scattered and dieing and resurrecting constantly or going AFK, and that simply doesn't work out in D3 because you can't do anything with 2 people in a game with 4 players. Most people will probably tell you that they never play in public games with people that they don't know. The whole social aspect of the game is completely lacking. It feels like I'm playing a single-player game, for the most part. Finally, there are already bots and gold-spammers.

The game is also very prone to exploits or cheap tricks to gain exp, gold, or what have you, since you can start on any quest on any difficulty. You can also get to a ""check point"", leave the game, resume, and be able to repeat something you had just done. So... people find things (areas, monsters, what have you) close to starting quests or check points that allow them to do something very fast repeatedly. Let me give some examples in more detail. There is an area before the first major boss with a ton of pots that can drop gold, so, people continuously start on a quest after this area (so you can TP there) and break all the jars, which takes like 1 minute, collect the gold, then quickly do it again, over and over. These are referred to as ""Crypt"" runs. So, if you want gold, you do that. If you want EXP quick you find a quest or group of monsters close to a check point or starting quest. For example, people are just repeating quests over and over. Examples are the boss Zulton Kulle and the first quest of Act 3 where a group of goblins spawn that can be killed very quickly. All this matters because if you want to do anything efficiently you will find yourself repeating something over and over that takes about 1 minute each time. Yup, that's Diablo 3. Even if you want to play the game ""normally"" you will probably want to farm rare items, in which case you will do the same thing over and over, such as a ""Butcher"" run, or ""Siege Breaker"" run. You do these because they have been determined to be the best spots for farming. This probably seems fairly reasonable since it is a Diablo game and in essence you will probably be repeating something, but at least in D2 the game wasn't so hard that some classes couldn't progress, period (I'm being literal, unless you're a rich, hardcore play. A regular player trying to go through Inferno on a Barb will hit a wall that even with pretty decent gear they will not be able to overcome). In addition, the best items could drop on any Act in D2. Some puny zombies in Act 1 could potentially drop the very best gear. And beside that, there really isn't much else to do in D3. You can join General chat and try to make some friends, if that is your desire, but you will be slapped in the face by a wall of a gold-spammers.

The game just isn't rewarding in general. From finding items to killing enemies. Items are a bore, and enemies are too hard. It isn't an enjoyable experience. The abilities are even pretty boring. D2 was a faster paced game, in my opinion, and the resource system wasn't as strict. In D3 you can't spam multishot for an extended period of time, for example. Anyway, Blizzard had claimed that there were literally trillions (was it? Maybe billions) of builds. Maybe, but they consider each one of those builds apparently completely unique even if you simply switch a single rune. In addition, you will find that most abilities are simply not as efficient as others for Inferno. Nothing is impossible, but trying to have fun playing the game with certain abilities would be over-shadowed by the sheer difficulty increase that came with the decision to do so. Most classes use a ""cookie-cutter"" build already. I will literally never use certain abilities because they aren't as good as others, period. It's also unfortunate that most of the abilities that seem fun are the most useless ones. Meteor seems awesome and brutal for a Wizard, doesn't it? Too bad it simply isn't a good ability and will make the game even harder than it already is. If you haven't played the game yet and are considering purchasing it, you may be telling yourself at this point that none of this will be true for you. That you are a great player and you will use whatever build you like, and that you will breeze through Inferno. Or maybe even that you won't use those farming spots over and over and over and over. Well, that part may be true, but you will die countless times on Inferno, and will more than likely use a build similar to everybody else. And more than likely you will also get bored because the most important element of the game is lackluster. Let me tell you, I am a hardcore player. I already have 150 hours on my Wizard. I liked the idea of Inferno being difficult. I wanted it to be so amazingly hard that only the most skilled players could do it. That's the kind of player I am and now I'm here condemning it. The difficulty is artificial and lazy. It is not a ""challenge"". To me a challenge implies that with some level of skill you can overcome the said challenge. Inferno isn't something you can really easily overcome with skill. It's a gear check (well, even with really good gear you will die a lot), and maybe a tiny bit of skill is involved (I've been on Inferno Diablo for a while for the record).  You will have to brute-force your way through while constantly dieing. Act 1 will seem reasonable, then, in Act 2, you will have enemies in your face faster than you can get away, and they will hit you 1 or 2 times and you will die. These aren't the type of enemies that are slow and powerful. Even the little fast ones that come in swarms (that you can't escape) will one-shot you. I'm usually stubborn about using defensive abilities over offensive, even if it makes things a little harder, but even I quickly realized I HAD to use defensive abilities that weren't appealing to me. This is just the truth of D3.

A lot of people would tell me this isn't D2, which is obviously true, but why change something that works? Some might consider D2 and unbalanced mess, but again, sometimes the flaws and imperfections of a game are what make it so fun. I'm not implying that D3 should have been made sloppily, or what have you, but they have overly refined and simplified it. Some things in D2 were indeed over-the-top, especially the items, but it without a doubt added depth to the game. I can tell D3 was designed around the Auction House, and that they wanted everything to be perfectly ""fair"" (IE no PK, for somebody might be ""grief'd"", which Blizzard won't have happen) and simplified for people. Unfortunately it left the game with no personality and no fun. In theory even I can admit it was a sound plan, but it surely did not work this time.","No fun, not well designed, broken at the core...",1339200000,237,{'Format:': ' Computer Game'},

Sonic CD is regarded as the best game for Sega's disastrous early 90s system. Personally, I think the best Mega CD game was...um...there were none. The console was an enormous flop which hurt Sega badly. But if Sonic CD is supposed to represent the system at the apex of it's powers then just how bad were the truly bad games?

I'll answer that question in another review if I ever get to play them. But for the moment I'll focus on the abyss of disappointment that is Sonic CD.

Development began in 1992 before the release of Sonic 2, thus the general appearance and level design is very close to that of the original Sonic, which dates the game badly for those of you who are more used to the polished, slicker, quicker feel of the sequels. Sometimes you'll go slow you'll begin to wonder why it wasn't called Chronic CD.

The levels themselves (useless time-travel feature aside) and boring and unengaging, You just breeze through them with little effort and no admiration. There's nothing that stands out and nothing truly define each level with it's own personality or style. The boss battles are also so easy a blind gamer could do it no sweat. And don't even get me started on those awful, awful Special Stages.

Why this is regarded as being the Mega CD's ""must have"" is beyond my understanding and I'm a man of noble intelligence. For a system that charged the consumer 350 ($470) you'd expect to have your mind blown by the content, but Sonic CD rates even lower that Sonic 1.

Still, at least the music is pleasant.

I don't know maybe there playing another game because from what I see from this game is not at all impressive. While the concept and graphics of the game is good, the control of this game is where it falls way WAY short. Controlling your characters is a task in itself and are too cumbersome, simply walking/running in narrow areas can get frustrating, I won't even going into aiming to kill birds that fly off the screen only to come back and attack you from the entirely other direction. I don't know if this was done intentially to make the game harder than it really is, but it works!! On top of that the characters seem slow to respond to your actions, when your trying to pick something up, you have to press the button and wait to see if it responds, you press the shoot button, and your characters just stand there while getting attacked, when your attcked by something an get pushed to the previous screen, you can still be attacked even though you can't see where it is so you can shoot it. Top this off with barely enough ammo to kill the cheesy zombies that grab you and take 7 shots to kill with the pistol. I'm sure the controls take some getting used to, but this game is just too boring to want to learn the controls. The game it self moves entirely too slow and it littered with too many useless and corny cut screens. Cut screens when you pick up something, cut screens when you walk up or down stairs, cut screens when you climb a ladder, cut screens when you open a door, cut screen when you switch character controls. And if the game wasn't already SLOW enough, text goes across the screen slooowly and there is no way to make it go faster. ""A..R..E.T..H..E.......F..A..I..N..T......S..O..U..N..D..S......O..F.........F..O..O..T..S..T..E..P..S.....T..H..O..S..E.....O..F.....S..U..R..V..I..V..O..R..S.?"" is NOT something I want to sit through EVERY SINGLE time I load a game.

I'm so glad I didn't pay full price for this game....If this game had fewer cut screens was more faster paced and most importantly, had controls like Xbox's Splinter cell, then maybe this would be a very good game. But as it stands, my second GameCube game is a waste of my time and money. I guess I was spoiled by my Xbox's splinter cell and even my game cube's Metroid Prime.

It didn't work then, and I don't think it works now. Traffic is still an issue which is enough to keep me from playing it. I've downrated the game to 1 star. I wish the game could have been as cool as it first looked to me. Maybe someday it will be.

Hello, many of you have probably heard about the terrible server issues this game had at launch. It has been nearly a week, and they are still ironing out those issues. I will use this space to focus on the game itself, rather than the problems its had with servers.

Over all the game is a blasts. The direction they are taking SimCity is really cool.

Maps are smaller, but you have to balance things more so you can't just build and build and build. Budget is smaller and things are more expensive, and monthly costs are also higher. So, as I said, you must balance everything carefully. The small map is not a bad thing when looking at it like this.

The buildings are modular, you can add on to them to make them more powerful, rather than having to place additional ones. This is pretty neat.

Roads are now what shape your city, rather than the grid-lines of previous games. Your zone density is linked to the roads, so you only have one type of zone for each of the residential, commercial and industrial. The higher density road capacity, the high density zone will develop.

Online multiplayer: it is a big part of the game, you basically can't get away from it. Even if you play a completely private game, where you play each city in your region, each city will still have to interact with the others in that region. Once you get to a certain point, cities need to share resources, citizens or other things. There is a great works feature in the region that all the cities can work towards. These are expensive and elaborate.

The online part does make for some frustration. If you hope to play whilst you travel on the train, or road, sadly you can not. Maxis/EA claims that this limitation, to always be connected to the internet, is so that their servers can do all the complex calculations so your computer doesn't have to. However, you'll probably notice at some point or another that you will lose connection, and yet you'll still be playing the game. This fact does make some people on the internet wonder if the always on feature is in fact DRM instead of the calculations mentioned. I don't know, and all I can confirm is that you will have to have your internet on if you want to play this game.

That said, all files are on EA servers, so you will not be able to reload if you make a bad choice or get a bad disaster.

I'm tired of typing, hopefully I've given you enough to think about. I really like the game, and as soon as they fix completely the server problems, I will have no issues with it.

Boy oh boy I should have listened to you guys. I could not have ejected this poor poor excuse for a game quick enough from my machine. Shame, shame, shame for shame. As a tradition when placing a new game into any console for the first time, I refrain from touching any buttons, making sure to watch any intro movies first. Kinda like the initial sip from a bowl of soup before you tackle the guts of it. Anyhow, after the ooo-ing and aaaa-ing at the intro movie; with a giant grin on my face I finally pressed start. That's where everything pretty much turned to a steaming pile of minke whale crap and my excitement turned to bitter, bitter, frustration. Amidst the graphical glitches, broken camera view points and horrible, horrible voice acting (tails' IQ seems to be dropping as his voice gets dopier with each passing game), the game just lacked any excitement.

Speaking of the Real Money Auction House, this destroyed the game. If you could buy BiS items off the gold AH and post them on the RMAH, what is the point of the gold AH? All the Chinese botters and farmers do it, they buy the gold items worth a dang and sell it on the real money auction house.

1.0,True,"05 10, 2011",ARTRFSZQPWY9I,B002DC8GKE,Ian B. Cooper,"Got Brink yesterday. This is an update to my earlier review. All I can say is, this is one frustrating game!

Firstly, the deep storyline I was looking forward to - all that potentially rich back-story that was hinted at in the pre-release videos and advertising... well it's not there. We get a couple of sentences from a disembodied voice telling how the Ark was a self-sustaining green vision of the future - and that's it! You don't even get a feeling for which side you identify with more, before the game forces you to choose a side. Talk about lost potential!

Then you get to customize your character. This is actually kinda fun (though weirdly laggy). Still, there are some very nice, unusual-looking characters with some great artwork. Then again, my daughter feels left out because there are no women characters available.

Then you go to the missions. This is not handled in a smooth way at all. If you choose to save the Ark you just choose a mission and you get a cut scene with a guy almost incomprehensible generic African accent babbling on about terrorists. Yes, it's the tired old 'terrorists have kidnapped someone, stolen a data chip, etc.', formula that we've seen in all the worst post-9/11 games.

Then comes combat.

I haven't seen a shooter with combat this bad since... Actually I've NEVER seen combat this bad. It's basically like an arcade 'duck hunt' game with targets that move around as if they're on some sort of futuristic speed-type drug. And you have to pump a clip or two into them in order to take them down. Meanwhile, even on easy difficulty you get killed if you get shot with a few rounds - and the AI have perfect aim. True, sometimes they're too stupid to even shoot at you at all, but when there are ten of them spawning around you, you haven't much hope.

I played on easy difficulty. I don't know anyone who can beat the missions on this game, but I know I can't. Easy difficulty is not supposed to pose a challenge! It's supposed to be easy - that's why it's called 'easy'. When you're developing a game, the difficulty levels are not there for the elite players - they'll choose 'super hard' every time. The rest of us need options that make it easier on us. Starting at 'impossible to do on your first five tries' is not 'easy'. I don't know why so many developers don't get this.

When you respawn (which you do a LOT), there's no option to respawn at a newly-captured station - you have to go all the way back to the start. So you end up spending a lot of time incapacitated, then you spend a long time running back to the action, then you get about two seconds of shooting (because the game's choke points are suicide). Then it's rinse and repeat.

The cut scenes seem tacked-on. None of them flow into or from the combat like other modern games' cut scenes do. So you get a jarring feel which make me suspect that the game just wasn't finished. I'd say this game needed another six months of development before it was ready for release. The developers have the kernel of a good game here, but it's not polished - heck, it's not even ready to be polished. This is a 'pre-alpha' version of the game Brink could have - should have - been.

This is in all ways a 1990s style shooter. None of the last decade's improvements are in this game - no cover, no CoD-style aim assist etc. - it's just run, shoot, respawn. Single player is incredibly frustrating and disorienting - and it only lasts a long time because the missions are almost unbeatable even on easy difficulty. Finishing a mission is virtually impossible in single player.

The smooth movement that was advertised is haphazard to say the least - sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Assassin's Creed does it right - this game, not so much.

The only good thing about this game is the character generation.

I've given this game a fair try. This one is going back to Amazon - assuming they accept opened games. I hate to say this, but it's basically a great character customization game with a Starsiege-Tribes-era FPS tacked on.

I've been playing video games for over 30 years, and of all the games I had high hopes for, this is the absolute worst.

Ok, to start off, I have owned this game for only twelve hours and am already completely frustrated.  For the twelve hours that I have owned this game, the servers have been down for six.  The registration server went down right after I gave them my credit card information (pretty convenient if you ask me).

Once that got going, they wanted me to download an update for the game.  That's cool, I was expecting this, but the update was like 16,000 files and several gigs of information!  Have they ever made update files before?  Why did I even spend the time to install the game if I had to redownload all the files anyways?  The setup continues...  Finally!  Now I have the updated FFXI and am ready to play.  My frustration is starting to subside.  I click the play button...  ...  ...  ...  All servers down for maintenance!?  Ok, here's a concept: backup servers!

At this point, I am completely frustrated.  I call the customer service number (which isn't toll free by the way) to ask for my money back.  Customer service number is busy.  Try again....  ...busy.

Take for example ""The Mystery of the Mummy"", a Sherlock Holmes mystery game that made the world's most famous detective seem insipid.  As lousy as some of their attempts have been in the past, high concepts keep players coming back to The Adventure Company.  ""Jack the Ripper"" has a concept so ideal it seems impossible to ruin, and yet the game is phenomenally atrocious.

The game is set in New York City in 1901.  A couple of poverty-stricken showgirls have been murdered in a fashion similar to the Jack the Ripper killings of 1888.  Jimmy Palmer, a na've young reporter, is assigned by his editor to write a series of newspaper articles on the killings.  As Jimmy looks into the murders, he discovers that the same serial killer might be responsible for both the 1888 and 1901 murders.  There's the high concept.  The game play is from the first-person perspective of Jimmy from beginning to end.  It consists of returning to the same locations and talking to the same people repeatedly, using dialogue options that aren't really all that optional.  Occasionally, Jimmy can collect items such as keys and money to appease stubborn suspects.  There are only one or two actual puzzles in the entire game.

  The game parades many characters based loosely on actual suspects in the real-life Jack the Ripper murders, but Jimmy never seems to come any closer to solving the mystery.  A game called ""Jack the Ripper"" should at least guarantee a creepy ambience, and the game seems to succeed in that area initially, but it soon becomes apparent that ambience isn't enough.  Menacing footsteps when no one is following you, whispered dialogue that is unintelligible and unimportant to the storyline, and shady characters that can't be interacted with and don't contribute anything to the plot become annoying after a short while.  In one room, a hushed, secretive whisper resembling ""I can sell you the most beautiful radishes"" can be heard repeatedly.  Dark, blood-stained alleys lose their creepiness after a while.  The score is beautiful and unnerving, but it only adds to the misleading feeling that something frightening is going to happen, and it hardly ever does.  There are also several moments in the game where Jimmy appears to have a psychic connection with a raven, leading to trippy graphic sequence with no pay-off.

Many critics have noted the series of Irish folk tunes performed by one of the game's characters as a bright spot.  The songs themselves are beautiful and haunting, like the game's score, but the animated performances that accompany them are less varied and more mechanical than a floorshow at Chuck E. Cheese's.  Also, be warned that there isn't a twist ending, just an anticlimactic one.  Maybe someday still The Adventure Company will redeem itself.  In the meantime, avoid this game.",The Adventure Company Drops the Ball,1149897600,4,,

Unfortunately the PS4 Season Pass disc does not allow you to download any of the episodes other than the first one (already on the disc).  It shows episodes 2-5 as ""coming soon"" even though 2-4 are definitely already out.  Even with the most recent update, and following advice from the TellTale Games Forums, when trying to load any other episode it simply says ""please connect to the Playstation Network"" to which I am already connected (verified by going into the Playstation Store, etc).  Been trying to get any loaded for the past week, hoping it was just temporary downtime in the Telltale Servers, but it seems to be something more, and something they give no indication of addressing anytime soon.

Final result?  They gave up saying they had no more suggestions.  Some PS4 Season Pass disc owners just can't download the episodes.

There was alot of hype over this game when it came out, and it's probably the only reason why Xbox sales were doing so well back then. I've pretty much gone back to playing PC games and my Xbox has been collecting alot of dust lately. Actually, the reason why I hate this game now is because of my friends. They used to make fun of Halo, then somehow, the demonic entity known as Halo took over their minds, their bodies, and their souls. We played everyday. They took it way too seriously and I can't stand playing Halo with them anymore. I began to notice some bad things about Halo:
-Everything about the game is way too childish. You play an invincible godlike character who just can't die thanks to his recharging shield and the powerups laying all over the place. The aliens are wimpy and cheesy. Plus there's an alien race that rips off John Carpentar's The Thing!!!!!!!
-Most of the game levels look the same! There were some variety, but not enough.
-Weapon names are too obvious. Quotes from people playing: ""Oh, I'm really good with the SNIPER RIFLE!"" ""SHOTGUNS are good when you want to fight somebody up close!"" ""You use the PISTOL way too much!""
-Vehicles were invincible. At least, the warthog and the tank was. How come most of the alien vehicles could be destroyed?
There's alot of other things I could say about Halo. I believe there was too much hype when the game was just like any other first person shooter. What really destroyed Halo was when it was released for Xbox instead of for PC like it was intended too so it could boost Xbox sales. The game probably never even reached it's full potential thanks to the Xbox. The game doesn't even looked finished.
The plot has way too much hope in it. Even though the human race is being annihilated by an alien race known as the Covenant, everything is hopeful because of the god you play as. At least with Half-Life, there was almost no hope because there was aliens as well as soldiers trying to kill you.

So my first problem with the game is its just point in click, like its still 1999. You are pretty much forced to play the game with just the mouse, pretty much as long you have a hand and 2 fingers you will do fine. I would have liked the game set to modern standards, as in full 3D behind the shoulder camera not over the top and proper controls.

My second problem is you have to be online to play single player. Which i understand cause it prevents people hacking and cheating and selling items on the AH but at the same time i shouldnt be forced to play online to play a singleplayer game. Heck many times i lag cause Blizzard servers suck.

My third problem is the game gets boring fast, So on my first playthough it was fun, i took my time finished it at around 25 hours, so then i have to play on nightmare mode doing the same thing as normal mode but harder monsters, and then repeat on hell mode and repeat on inferno. Now once you get to inferno you have to grind for HOURS AND HOURS to get by, Once you complete act 1 inferno, you need to grind for 20-50 hours JUST to gear up and stand a chance in Act 2 Inferno. Its boring doing the same old thing over and over and over.

My forth problem is that, game has been out for nearly a month YET its Auction house is still not working right. Not only that we were suppose to have Real money Auction house on the 22nd of may and still don't have it.

My fifth problem is, like MMOs, the game has to have server maintenance of 6-8 hour downtime. Never have i played a ""single player game"" where i have to deal with weekly 8 hour maintenance.

Lastly my sixth problem is HACKS. A lot of people are getting hacked left and right. Why? I don't know. Never have i played a game with so many people getting hacked. Nice security blizzard has. Even with the authenticator people are still getting hacked.

The biggest problem with this game is that it forces you to complete an entire multiple stage mission without being able to save after any part of it. I completed the first part of mission #1 and was unable to save after this stage which should have been a save checkpoint. Once I completed this part, I promptly got shot in the head on the (harder) second part of mission #1 and was forced to try the entire mission over.

The aming with any of the guns is absolutely horrible as well. The orders you can give to your teammates is restricted to covering fire, taking point, throwing grenades or coming back to your position. Your team also won't engage any enemy they see on their own either without you firing or directing them to provide covering fire.

Ordinarily, an enhanced enemy AI would be a good thing, but even during the first mission, the enhanced AI is a disaster. I have yet to have been wounded, I simply get shot in the head and die immediately. I'm not getting close to the enemy either and am prone on the ground behind foliage, yet I get shot in the head during a firefight every time. This doesn't make any sense.

Also, what made the original Ghost Recon unique has been taken out of this game. You are one character in the game, you cannot switch to different soldiers on your team like in the previous GR PC and PS2 games.

I wrote a review for this game yesterday and checked to see if it was up today and there are now zero reviews!  There were about 2 dozen 1-star reviews and a smattering of 4-5 star reviews from ppl who hadn't played the game yet but were sure it would rock.  Amazon are you caving to vendors now?
Anyway, here is my review...again.
This game is a complete ripoff.  LOTR2 is one of my favorite games of all time; if it ran on win2k I'd still play it (tip: it runs on XP in compatibility mode).  LOTR3 is nothing like it.  In fact they seemed to take everything good about LOTR2 out and replace it with ... nothing.  Specifics:
1) Terrible documentation!!!  The booklet that came with the game is completely insufficient and online/on cd docs are almost identical to the printed one.  This is a recurring theme in my review.  You are basically sitting there looking at stuff you can't click on wondering what to do.
2) All micro-management of resources is gone.  You assign a peasant to a parcel of land and then ignore it completely as he makes food automatically.  Same goes for soldiers and money.  No ability to change what type of soldiers or food.  Or maybe there is but there is NO DOCUMENTATION!!!
3) You can't conquer pieces or territory anymore.  You can only devastate them and you have to take out the main castle and then you get all of the territories at once.  This took a large part of the strategy out of the game.
4) Hiring mercs is a gamble because you only see their title like ""siege engineer"" and a tiny piece of info, which didn't include the cost of hiring them.  Maybe there is a way to find this info, but there is NO DOCUMENTATION!!!
5) You can't upgrade the castles except in your main province.  Read that line again.  They took out one of the most fun aspects.
6) Upgrading your main castle is a crap shoot since you have the option to downgrade, but still pay money to do so.  So you have a level 5 castle and can buy and build a level 2 castle thinking you are getting an upgrade.  The in-game descriptions of the castles consist of the castle name (ie ""strong stone castle"") and a really small picture - nothing else.  NO DOCUMENTATION!!!
7) You upgrade castles by saving money and buying the upgrade.  After about 30 real-world minutes of saving someone steals my money every time.  I have no idea how or how to stop them because there is ... (boy I'm getting tired of typing this) NO DOCUMENTATION.
8) During battle scenes you can't zoom in or out which makes it difficult to manuever your forces or even tell what troop types you are facing.  The graphics are not that good despite being *very* hardware intensive (more on that coming up).
9) The graphics are *very* hardware intensive (told ya ;-)).  ""Recommended"" specs are 1.5GHz, 256RAM and if you use ATI, a Radeon 8500 or later.  I have a 2200+ CPU (clock speed ~1800MHz), 512MB DDR 400 RAM, and a Radeon 9700 Pro.  During sieges I got to watch arrows fly at my troops *frame-by-frame*.  That was with 2 enemy units vs 3-5 of mine, not a massive battle at all.
10) After allying myself with another county I accidentally clicked on that county while controlling my army.  I was automatically at war despite being 2 counties away and immediately clicking somewhere else.  Lame.
11) Sieges.  The crowning achievement of LOTR2.  They suck in LOTR3.  Instead of attacking the front of a castle where the defenders are massed, I went around the side.  The defenders didn't reposition themselves.  So I climb the walls, get all my guys on top of the wall and they ... mill around randomly.  They almost completely ignore my commands, and the worst part... I CAN'T TARGET THE DEFENDERS!  So I sit there gaping while 2-3 archers (not 2-3 units of archers) mow down my 3 units who are standing right next to them.  I repeated this experiment several times with same results.
12) Attacking an army on the field is lame.  If you set up two units to attack one unit from different angles, both your units just bee-line right for the center of the enemy unit anyway.  Not anything like the cool tricks you could play with the Total War series.  No usage of terrain or weather or anything.
Summary: This game is actually *less advanced* than LOTR2 in a lot of ways.  The only advancement I saw was in graphics, which were sub-standard anyway.  If you cherish LOTR2 like I do, AVOID THIS GAME!

A while back I wrote a review which stated ""Developers give to professional game reviewing companies a piecemeal display of the actual product to review, and when the final product is sold based on those reviews it is NOT what was advertised"".

Randy Pitchford the CEO of Gearbox Software originally worked for EA (Electronic Arts). When he created his own gaming company years after leaving EA, he and Gearbox Software earned credit for their reputation by creating ""Borderlands"". After earning a reputation in the gamin industry and community, THIS game right here that you are considering buying is the game that will remain in the minds of consumers when ever placing any faith in Randy Pitchford and Gearbox software ever again. Why? Because ""if"" you purchase this game you need to know ""what"" you are paying for. ANYTHING you read in this review is something that can be researched on the web, and found repeatedly by example after example.

Gameplay-
Horrid. The AI in this game destroys any and all hope of an enjoyable experience. Regularly while playing this game the ""aliens"" would fall through the floor, disappear through walls, get stuck in loopy animations throughout the environment, and would even (and this is just disgusting development) kill you AFTER they were nowhere near you because the game would try to auto-correct the AI location after the aforementioned and despite not being in the same room as you are the aliens would still do damage to you. In other words the alien that just fell through the floor is now somewhere in the data of the game swinging at you and killing you despite not really being in the same room you're in.

The AI of the good guys in this game has them running into walls, corners, standing in doorways blocking you, firing their guns at you, even got to the point where people who were programmed to help you were trapping you in corners of rooms while the aliens not even located there were killing you blocked in a corner. In one scene in a hanger bay, the aliens are falling from a ceiling all onto the the same spot atop of a dropship. From the dropship they are all jumping to the same location onto the floor... and falling through the floor into god only knows where. All I know is no matter where I was this transpired about 10-12 times before I went online to find out why.

Graphics-
BEFORE the actual product (""Aliens:Colonial Marines"") was released Randy Pitchford was SHOWING the GAMEPLAY to everyone everywhere. Randy Pitchford showed the ""footage from the actual game"" albeit a ""work in progress"" to advertise this product. The things you see on the web that advertise this game ARE NOT IN THIS GAME. Everything that is a form of advertisement for this game from ""Gearbox Software"" is a LIE. The ""in-game"" footage that is all over the web being used to advertise this game is NOT IN THIS GAME. It is NOT WHAT YOU ARE GETTING if you buy this product. The graphics are absolutely the most horrid graphics Ive seen in 20 years of gaming.

The best way to describe the graphics in this game is this.
Imagine watching a low-resolution mpg on a PC from 1996. Only its interactive, and you can explore the environment by moving around. The pixelating, screen fracturing, jumpy environment... it literally appears as if your watching several puzzel pieces being moved if each puzzle piece made up a portion of your TV screen. tHE IMAGE FRAGMENTATION IS so bad that I literally HAD, and I mean HAD to STOP playing it.

Sound-
Its all sound bites. The actors from the original movie cannot be blamed for what was done to them in this product. Everything you hear in this game appears to be a ""sound bite"" from the movie ""Aliens"" minus some additional voice acting. The sound of the pulse rifles, the sound when an alien jumps on you, even the sound of the shotgun from the original movie ""Aliens"" appear to be recorded from the movie and poorly dubbed into this game. I EVEN found an app on my phone that had the sounds on it from an app that was out before the game and using Sony Vegas recorded the sounds from my phone app, then recorded the sounds from the captured gameplay and lined them up and found them to be... YES, identical.

Multiplayer-
No. I'm not going to even go there.

Overall-
**THIS game was advertised using footage from a product that Gearbox Software is not selling you. When you are looking at the actual footage of ""what"" Randy Pitchford is selling, and receive what he actually gives you, you will discover you have been flat out undeniably lied to. If you chose to give Randy Pitchford and Gearbox Software your money for this game, you are buying a game that was literally made somewhere between 5-9 months. Information has come out that this game was given to gearbox Software from Sega, Sega payed Gearbox Software a huge amount of money to finish this game, and Randy Pitchford took that money and sent the game to Timegate Studios (another company) and told Timegate to finish the game. As of the date of this posting a large group of individuals at Timegate have been fired/let-go that worked on ""Aliens:Colonial Marines"".***

The bottom line is simple here.

If you are out in the world and you are selling something YOU are responsible for selling it.
Randy Pitchford told us, showed us, and advertised to us what he ISNT SELLING.
If you buy this game you are buying a broken, poorly developed, horridly designed and miserably put together non-functional video game.

This is not a videogame.
This is a lie, and Randy Pitchford was the one out there telling it so he can have your money.

i did the standard ""i play games on a PC"" thing - download latest drivers, instal patches, Google for hours, read the support forums, etc. It seems like spending hours trying to figure out why a game won't work is a part of the PC gaming experience, which as i was reading the 30th ""yeah, i get that exact same error but i also can't find a workaround and the company won't respond to forum posts or emails"" i realized was pretty sad. Some games crash occasionally (Dark Messiah), some frequenty (SiN Episode 1), some are unconscionably laggy (Mass Effect) and some work perfectly (Half-Life 2, Gears of War, Oblivion, Neverwinter Nights 2, at least on my new computer, etc.). TimeShift is the first one where i have never, ever even seen the game run in any way, shape or form. i wondered why a game so many people said they liked was being sold so cheap. Yes, the game is old, but even old games these days sell for at least $20. Now i know. The game has been out long enough that all tech problems should be patched now but i'm finding plenty of people having problems and all of them have exactly the same error with the same error message that's 100% reproducible and not one person has gotten it working - that sounds to me like the problem that is easiest to solve (widely seen, perfectly reproducible).

Clark,"I'm a big fan of Razer mice; the DeathAdder is easily one of the most comfortable and accurate bare-bones mice I've ever owned, and the Naga is something every MMO gamer should give a try. I picked up this Anansi to replace a dying Logitech G15, expecting something of similar quality and usability, but unfortunately after a day of using it I'd have to say it's one of the worst gaming products I've ever bought.

The good:
The software is easy to set up, and works very well; it's familiar to anyone who's used the Naga, as the macro and customization is mostly identical. The backlight on the board is also really nice, and allows you to customize the color it displays in the same as the backlighting on Alienware's laptops.

The bad:

Everything else.

The modifier keys would be useful, but they're not easily reachable and are sectioned off in a way that offers no tactile feedback as to which you're actually hitting. They're also the only part of the keyboard that isn't backlit, and they really need to be. Unfortunately, I just can't see them being really useful; same with the modifier keys on the far left of the board, which have the same problem as those on the Logitech gaming boards...they're just not in the path of anything that makes them fast enough to hit accurately when playing a game.

The sticky key complaints are the biggest factor, though, and it's absolutely inexcusable for a gaming board to have this problem. I only used the board for two days, and had enough frustration with keys being stuck on a function after hitting with another key that I was fed up almost instantly with the keyboard. This just should not happen on a gaming keyboard. It doesn't happen on a $20 OEM board that's made for business use, so on a $100 board designed for gaming... if it was very occasional, or rare, maybe I could deal with it but not multiple times per gaming session. It's too hard to recommend a keyboard with the problems this has for any price.","Absolutely not worth the money, buy something else.",1325808000,2,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

After playing the trilogy while growing up on the Playstation One, I than awaited for Insomniac to make some new Spyro Gems for the Playstation Two.
How disturbing this series has become since than. Spyro: Enter the Dragonfly and Spyro: A Hero's Tail were alright, although the first one of this whole new series did have a bunch of clichs, and the second one was frustrating, this game is a failure.
What have they done to you Spyro? Now you are ""Spyro Baggins,"" going off on your new little quest, which is totally wrong.

Mafia II was full of it regardless the rail game ideology and progress count. So, since this review will have no pros and only the cons, let me start from the basic design errors:

1.)  The cars. It doesn't matter what u drive - all cars are the same in terms of maneuverability/handling. In mafia 2 even in the very beginning I could feel the difference every time I got in a new one.

2.) Weapons. a) player cannot carry enough ammunition - not enough ammo at all. NEVER ENOUGH AMMO. b) AND NOT ENOUGH GUNS. MORE GUNS TO CARRY and more ammo is a must in this type of video game. Especially considering the fact that there are more potential enemies on the streets that protagonist have to deal with. This is probably the dumbest design idea in the entire game. If player holsters a machinegun, it's not visible at all, even if he is wearing a totally worn out dirty t-shirt. So if it's not about realism to you, dear game developers, why can't he carry more ammo and more pistols????

3.) Witnesses. Enough said I guess. You are pushing the player to kill more innocent people in the video game. Why couldn't you just arm the protagonist with a picklock and allow five seconds to picklock the car (ten seconds on ""easy"" mode)?

4.) Where the heck is the garage for my stolen cars????????

5.) Hand-to-hand combat mode is just terrible.

6.) The economy part... I wonder if the game developers are still familiar with an elementary math or they completely lost it.... The guys managed to steal 2 million and change from the federal reserve in the beginning, split it for a number of people and Sammy sounded like he was reborn as a truly rich guy. And look at the arm dealer's truck prices... I bet you a dollar  the player would have to spend about million bucks on guns and ammo alone during main storyline - so what kind of FREEDOM Sammy was talking about? 7000 dollars for an average gun. I bet you a dollar, today in 2016 the street prices on guns are not that high. Again, Mafia II was so beautifully designed at that point.

7.) Health. What's with the dumb green cross boxes? If they wanted to imitate Doom - why couldn't they just spread the first aid bags through out the entire city? It would be even dumber, but hey that's the goal in Mafia 3, right?..  to make it dumber, just like the Assassin creed sequels when they designed those doctors.... unbelievable BS.

8.) The safe.... I wonder,  did 2K hire those losers who designed the safe in Assassin Creed, after Ubi eventually fired them (probably after reading my reviews on their latest junk)

So, putting it all together I do have to say that this is definitely one of the dumbest and the most primitive video games out there (maybe not as primitive as AC, but still pretty dumb).",So dumb compare to Mafia II,1479945600,7,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

When the game was first revealed, it showed so much potential. Everything looked so beautiful. Fast forward 2-3 years to release and we get a product that doesn't live up to the hype. Instead, we are greeted with a steaming plate of disappointment.

There is one thing that truly pissed me off as this game neared release. The developer for the game always dodged certain questions and answered them indirectly. Allow me to explain one important question they avoided: They did NOT at any point before the game's release say there wouldn't be multiplayer. They just said there would be a very small chance that you'd see other players in the massive world.

On launch day, two streamers managed to get on the same planet, same outpost, and talk to the same NPC all at the same time. But guess what? They couldn't see nor interact with one another. The developer gave a sketchy response to this, and pretty much dropped from the face of the Earth (or in this case, Reddit).

I truly felt cheated. Not only was there no real multiplayer in this game (which had SO much potential!), the game is quite repetitive after the first few hours of gameplay. Now for those that don't know, the game's main goal is to reach the center of the universe. As much as I now despise this game, I will not spoil it for those who want to give it a try.

The only thing that this game had going for it was its 18 quintillion ""randomly generated"" planets and animals/NPCs. I can tell you right now, that you will be disappointed after 10-15 planets. Sure it is cool for the first few planets, but then you realize that they are almost similar to one another with another skin just pasted on top. On another note, the random animals you will encounter are NOTHING like the ones in the trailer you saw a while ago. These creatures are randomly generated and have no climate preference or traits for said climate. For example, you may end up seeing a green floating crab with tentacles on a burnt down scorching planet. It just makes no sense.

The game follows a repetitive formula: Land on planet, grab resources, fly out of planet, restock resources, eventually build materials to warp, warp to new system in hopes of reaching the Center of the Universe, rinse and repeat. This got old and boring really fast. There has even been a case where someone got a fully loaded suit and ship all on his starting planet!

On another note, this game lost 90% of it's player base just one week after release. If this isn't a red flag, then I do not know what is!

If you still have plans to purchase this game, please purchase this when it goes on sale. It is truly not worth the $60.

1- The BUGS and no, I'm not talking about the accidentally released ""preview build"" that excited fans purchased on steam at midnight(My friend was unlucky enough to get that crap) I'm talking about the horrible hit boxes for the zombies. It's completely random whether or not you have enough reach (or too much, sometimes the zombies will be too close for it to register). I was playing coop with a friend and for some reason, people kept addressing me as ""him"" even if I played a chick. What's the kicker however, is that there isn't even a day one patch to fix (allegedly) 37 major bugs, many of them game ending glitches.

2- The STORY we all remember the stunning first trailer (that put it on the map) of the father trying to save his dying daughter to the sound of a lone violin. Well, this game has none of that. Instead, what we get is 4 playable characters who, although they have a paragraph of info at the start, don't do anything for the plot. Where is the emotional drama you might ask? All the characters do is regurgitate the same one liners like ""Take that, bitch!"" to stupid zingers.

3- The ENVIRONMENT- We were told that this would be open world, and it certainly is. How much of it is interactive? Very little. Outside of the weapons and health items, pretty much the only things that even move are the slow moving beach balls and chairs. Zombies are also not randomly spawned like left for dead, all you need to do is pay attention to exactly where the ""bosses"" come from and then avoid those places since they mostly offer little worthwhile rewards addressed in my next point

4- The WEAPONS- I'm not saying there isn't imagination in the weapon designs, they're quite creative. Unfortunately, most become useless to your almighty foot. Kicking takes no stamina, the knock back of enemies brings them to the floor, and you can upgrade your ""foot"" ability to the point where if you are ever surrounded, all you need to do is put your back to a wall and start kicking.

The ""Rabaul raid"" is now broken into several segments and a strategy can be formed besides ""kill everything that moves."" I still believe that the game is a great way to teach the geography and importance of the individual battles in WWII.  The game is challenging, but much better to play.  I would change the ratings, but Amazon will not let me.

OLD REVIEW (4/2007)
Playing the game is initially is fun.  The planes are responsive , except you can't see where you are going.  However, the mission ""Rabaul raid""  cannot be won and campaign stops there.  There isn't any strategy that can be employed to win.  Therefore, play is restricted restricted to lower levels and early campaigns over and over again.  A real shame, because it is a great way to teach kids about WWII history.  Ubisoft won't help, and their website is useless.  I am going to ask them for my money back, and follow up with FTC for fraud vis a vis unsuitability for intended purpose. very disappointing.","Wii version is great , but You are not going to win the old Xbox version!",1176508800,6,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii'},

- The DLC transfer process is absolutely awful. Did Harmonix even think about it?! There's no way to download your purchases in bulk, and if you go song-by-song through the store, the 'purchased' information doesn't represent reality. So, you have to click every song, try to buy it, and then see if you own it already via the Xbox Live message. It takes HOURS.
- There's no way to adjust instrument (or vocal) volumes in-game without pausing (at least not that I can find).
- Doesn't work with ION Drums (I know I said it already, but it's shameful).

After years and years of amazing Rock Band gameplay, this iteration is seriously lacking. The horrible implementation of prior DLC support is embarrassing (and a massive waste of time)... especially because the only reason people are buying this game is to move their library to the current platform (as the on-disc songs are mediocre at best). No ION drum support is shameful, especially since it's USB (there are no proprietary drivers or wireless chips to deal with). I'm willing to bet that ION drummers make up a huge chunk of their monthly DLC revenue. At least make it work with the MIDI Pro Adapter (also a no)!

I did this with The Last of Us, and ended up buying the Amazon ps3 game after a full Redbox playthrough. Easily the best game on ps3 along with Tomb Raider(new version). Uncharted games come in after these, which suffer from a little bit of gunplay fatigue.

This game got so much hype it was ridiculous. My first reservations about Destiny were Bungie involvement. I played Halo and found it merely playable. Halo enemies sounded like little smurf creatures I should be petting instead of shooting. I know people were gaga about Halo, but I'm not a teenager. I'm an older guy gamer, and like a little more sophistication to my playing experience. Why not just break out Halo 1 and 2 for a go-around again? This Destiny affair is like going on a date with a gum chewing, cigarette smoking, and boring story teller. The game immediately drops you off in some dark corridor. You have no idea why you are there!! Aliens are jumping out of everywhere sniping at you. You kill them. You move to another area or hallway and shoot some more. Hello, this is worse than Halo. AND, you move next to a bigger area and shoot more aliens from a farther distance. Each alien is tough and requires many shots before death sets in. So, you kill them, and move to another area and shoot aliens from 100 yards away. WOW, this is really fun. I've never played a game where I just killed hundreds of aliens time after time. Oh, wait, Halo was like that.

Someone please get a copy of an old Half Life game 1a, b, or c, and then go to Half Life 2a, b, or c. Those are games. The design teams on Half Life games actually ask themselves periodically, ""Are we doing the same thing to much, or is there shooter fatigue setting in?"" Which brings me back to my previous mentions of Tomb Raider and The Last of Us, these games provide a massive amount of variety to keep your mind from numbing over with shooting millions of aliens. I still can't believe Halo was so hugely popular. Kids could play it without getting stumped by difficult puzzles?

A couple of notes about graphics. This is also the least good looking game I've played on ps3 in .....EVER. Looks terrible and washed out, and not as good as Halo in 480p. ps4 is obviously better looking, but I have games from ten years ago that make this look like DOOM 1. Riddick, STALKER, Half Life2, Crysis, Max Payne, and Far Cry to name a few are great looking games, especially on pc. STEAM has the entire Half Life/portal franchise for sale at under ten dollars, now there's some games to play at $50 less. Anyone that has never played the original Max Payne, you should, and can be put on cell phones now, and plays well on them.

Lastly, There are way too many great games to play for a paultry some of money, even used. Why blow $60 on mindless first personage. OK, here's another great game, your last tip. I picked this up on Amazon, I think, for $6, and it is called Bulletstorm. I played it through in a day, and then played it through the next day, and have never done that before. It had to be a blast, literally. Flat out fun and a very inventive game. Not too difficult, but challenging at times. Who doesn't like being able to kick baddies with a monster power boot?

Visually the game is ugly. What on Earth eye the publishers thinking. I've seen 3DS titles that looked cleaner. When you need every sense available in a game that is so punishing hard, losing sight of enemies because they are so blocking they blend into the background isn't acceptable.

The camera is uglier. For most of the game I felt claustrophobic add the camera zooms in tensely. Due to the nature of the game you need to scan a lot and a boxed in camera gets tiresome quick.

The targeting system is the worst. Why the lock target button is mapped to the camera orient button I'll never know. If you have to fight more than one enemy you'll be hosed. The target will jump if you try to seeing the camera too aggressively. It also seems like the camera swings wildly when running up on an enemy to land a critical attack if a second enemy comes out. Wouldn't be as big of a deal if the death system want the way it is with this series.

My final complaint with this series is the lack of reward for exploration. It takes a lot to win a single battle with a tough opponent and you have a slim chance of making it to the next bonfire so it's not very rewarding to go out on a limb.

The straw man with this series is that any criticism is met with people saying it has faults. Yes the difficulty is up there. I don't mind that. I don't want a game that allows me to bull rush a room without a strategy and win. Dying usually makes a game more fun but not this one.

It seems like 75% of the game consists of boring cutscenes that you can't skip. It almost is like one of those lame movies your teachers made you watch that you had no way of getting out of watching. I am fine with some cutscenes if they actually are more than people yacking for 20 minutes and are fluid with the flow of the game. That's not the case at all here.

Aside from the cutscenes, there is some basic platforming thrown in. This will consist of about 15% of the rest of your time. The remaining 10% is actually action and shootouts. Not only is this obviously disappointing for a ""shooter"" game, but its also even worse because the shootouts are a pain in the neck. The camera angles suck. The game does have a decent cover system even if it is borrowed from other games like Gears of War. I don't mind that, but when every time I get hit while shooting I get thrown out into full stance and have to re-do my cover, what is the point? Isn't the point of cover when you get hit to be able to stay in cover and not start all over again?

I'd like to touch base on the campaign and multiplayer separately:

The Campaign:
Somewhat unique. After completing a campaign level, the player is granted the ability to customize their starting loadout for that particular campaign level.
Example - you can now play through the same level again, but starting with extended mags on your primary weapon. We've seen this before in some other shooters, but at least it allows for some replay value. Overall the campaign is not very engaging. The story is just plain bland.

The Multiplayer:
More or less this is the same multiplayer as always. The pick ten system is the newest addition. It simply allows for further customization of one's class setup.
Some good strides have been made to make this game more balanced. With a series of hotfixes and patches, previously overpowered class setups have now been weakened to create an even playing field.
Other areas where Trearch has failed this game are in the lag, spawn and probation systems. I do understand that lag is not an easy fix. There are many factors and variables involved. The spawn and probabtion systems are easy fixes and Trearch has done nothing to fix them.
The probation system puts players on probation for 1:00, 5:00 or 10:00. This means that they can not join a multiplayer game for said amount of time due to the following reasons I've noticed: getting booted from a pregame lobby, leaving a game early, the host quits, you turn off your system and go to work during a game :(

I looked around...thought about it...and tossed that piece of twice-tossed monkey dung right in the freaking trash.  Did I want the $3 credit from the gamestore?  NOPE!  I refused to subject any other human being, decent or indecent, to the vile putridity of this shiny circular turd.  I feel guilty that I didn't snap the disk in half first for fear some homeless kid living outside the dump and stealing electricity from a storage shed's power outlet might find this game and try it.

If imitation is the highest form of flattery, this these people obviously hate the Hitman franchise and here's why.

1. Hitman allows you to use stealth or be bloody violent. In this game, it's stealth or nothing, your character dies too quick if he starts shooting.

2. Putting a device on a phone to record a conversation is fun. Having to walk to a payphone to hear the conversation, and then having to kill one person AND beat up someone else (or use chloroform) another, but do not kill him, is not fun.

3. How can I use stealth to kill a Nazi scientists that always stays in the same area and has plenty of Nazis watching his back? That last mission was the one that made me give up and go back to Fallout 4.

In conclusion, this game had a lot of potential but I should have listened to the negative reviews. Yes, killing people in exotic locations always turns me on, but the controls are too clunky, the choices are too few.

Unfortunately, it isn't decent, it isn't fun, and it's really not even paying 10 bucks for. That's how bad it is. To sum up what this game is, it's just a bunch of depthless minigames that take about thirty minutes each to beat, until, that is, you get to the space stage. The first phase, cell phase, is the only semi-fun one; of course, it's probably the most dumbed down of all phases. This phase only takes a few minutes to beat. The creature phase can take a long time depending on whether you befriend or attack everything. This phase is aggravating and boring.

The tribal phase is so easy that it can only take you around 20 minutes to beat. In this phase, you're pretty much forced to ally with the other tribes, as using warfare takes forever and gets you nowhere. Once you get past the tribal phase, it's time for the civilization phase, which is more or less the same as the tribal phase, only it's a lot easier to kill everyone. In this phase, your people develope so quickly it's unrealistic; they get vehicles right after the tribal phase, and soon after develope ships and warplanes. Ultimately, this phase is the second most frustrating.

The space phase is the last and worst phase. If you don't ally with at least one major empire, you're screwed, for lack of a better word. Of course, you're forced to go stop ecodisasters and stop pirates, and for whatever reason, they can't do it themselves. The best items cost a ridiculous amount of sporebucks(the currency in spore), and it can take hours to get enough money just to get the planet buster, and you can only use it once before you buy another one.

After a while, you'll get used to killing pirates and stopping ecodisasters and defeating the Grox(the cheesy, borg-like rat-villains of the game). Your main goal, later on, is to get to the center of the universe. You'll find that most of the races in the universe sound the same, and that some even look the same; that being said, it makes it feel like there's no variety in races, which, there isn't much of. It's almost painful to reach the center of the universe. You have to not only defeat the Grox, but you have to beat the other hostile empires. This took me around 4 days for me to do, and that was to only get near the center of the universe. That's 4 days wasted.

To sum it all up, this game is a dumbed-down, boring piece of trash that was so overhyped that, in order to avoid a tide of hate mail, places like Gamespot gave it a positive review to save their butts.

I beg fellow gamers to either not buy this game, or pirate it. The game is not worth 50, or even 10 dollars, and the fact that there's a draconian DRM attached makes it even worse; you can only install the game 3 times on a computer. That means that if your computer loses all of its data 3 times, or you want to install it on 3 computers, you'll have to call EA customer support in order to get an extra install. EA games treats its customers like criminals. They've tightened their grip so much that this game is becoming the most pirated game of all time. I'd bet if NASA knew that this game would be THIS bad, they wouldn't shown it.

I say it again: Do not buy this game. Don't waste your time, money, or sanity trying to play or buy this game, and if you absolutely must have it, then pirate it. They thoroughly deserve it.

This sequel marks the end of Diablo series as we knew it. Unfortunately, not for the better. The game is generic and boring. Mainly due to oversimplification of the aspects that made prior games so successful, including character customization (skills and items) and story. The game immersion experience is as result poor and feels more like a fast paced combat or arcade game than a Role Playing Game.

Graphics
While updated and more subtle, graphics fail to offer visibility and immersion. This has been the struggle of game developers in the last decade or so to introduce the 3rd dimension, and too often, it was a failure. In Diablo III, you end having neither the visibility you had when in isometric 2d, or the immersion you would have in total 3d.
Additionally, the graphics are too cartoonish, cute and polished to provide the feeling you would expect in a dungeon crawling scary game. Diablo I and II were far more scary and offered enough `evidence' for your imagination to trigger visions of horrors.
In game cut scenes are an absolutely joke and seem to have been made for an arcade game from the 80's (only slightly exaggerating....), anyway,  not in line with the sprit of the prior games slow, terrifying, intense cut scenes.
Cinematics are as usual of the highest quality.

Music and sound
Music and sound effects are excellent, even if you will find some of the merit is low given most comes the original game.
Character voice: are you kidding me ? Just listen  to the female monk  and you will stop there.

Gameplay
That is where the disappointment is the largest: hardly any customization of character: we all follow the same blend generic skill progression path.

Immersion
None whatsoever. I feel absolutely not committed to my character whose development seems to be just following a script. Similarly, the story seems to be a generic repeat of prior games.
All (items, quests) seems to be delivered too fast for me to actually care of the objective or the outcome. The quests are delivered by an actor reading very fast the highlights of you will end up having to do. Yes, no more slowly unfolding mystery: you know pretty much all from the first moment. So complete lack of style from the art direction.
Items
This used to be the single point of unquestionable force of the prior versions gameplay. You are now overwhelmed with low quality items that hardly change anything to the gameplay: Diablo I and II were item based RPGs. It would make or break your character. Now, you have the choice every minute to change your items from lower quality to low quality. Blizzard went exactly the wrong way: they added even more varieties of the useless items. Of course, you can be sure that you will ultimately find some great items, but this may require some extra real money using the auction house done for this very purpose.

Server Dependency
So, there will be instances you are not able to play the game. And when you are, you may see all action suddently stopped. That's right: you are not in control, Battle net is. The final flaw that seals it all.

Conclusion: sadly have to recommend you go look for other games, especially for this type of money.  By the way if you have not noticed, I was and still am a huge fan of both Diablo I and II.",LOST IMMERSION and STYLE,1337385600,23,{'Format:': ' Computer Game'},

The voice acting is magnificently done, and even when the story is weak, the ambient and the interpretation of that story still pull you in and make you feel engaged. However, the developers choice to force nearly everything into a public dungeon ruins everything. Its standard to engage on an immersive quest only to find yourself sneaking through a sewer while waves of other players rush by you and jump your boss encounter, killing him and completing the quest for you.

Most quests are in such public areas and there is no way around it: you will be rushing through them to at least feel you lied a finger on that boss.

On the other hand, there ARE some quest lines that are entirely private. These are ok, however they suffer the entirely opposite problem: you cant ever group them. I'm not talking about strangers now, I'm talking about you and a friend engaging together into these quests. Each one of you will be forced to do things on their own and rejoin later.

And finally, a system  (arguably great)  that changes the world based on your quest progress means even in public areas, you may not be able to group with your friends but still see strangers poking around your experience. This is because the technology that ""changes the world"" works like a curtain, one that falls in between your teammates and you unless both happen to be in the exact same quest.

Again, the game has a great atmosphere, fantastic reenactment of quest, and extremely fun combat system. However, it arbitrarily jumps between forcing you to solo and making you play with strangers in a rush while preventing you to group with friends.","Bittersweet game, many magnificent things crippled by few fatal design choices.",1398729600,10,,

Now that it has, I realize this game was all hype and no substance. For starters, the controls are VERY awkward. You spend time thinking about how you will execute the movement in parts of the game when they should just come natural. The biggest flaw design is that the designers have set up the game play where you must decide what items you want to use for each chapter BEFORE you begin the chapter. This seems fine at first, but as you play the game, they don't even give you the option to drop ANY items! So once you are full you are STUCK with them. How stupid is this??? Then there is the story. The designers decided to tie ALL the Resident Evil stories together to give it a sense of ""full circle"". Initially this seemed intriguing, but then as you play the game, the SAME old bosses that you encountered in Resident Evil 4 are here too. You attack one and the little creatures spring out from his back or head. Gee, didn't see that one coming. But what really got me was their decision to go from a night time horror game to a daylight one. You can see EVERYTHING in the day light. What genius thought this up? Since the bad guys can be seen, they have them ""hiding"" in areas where it doesn't make much sense, like the marshland. They were hiding in the water and just jumped out. I know they are infected with the Las Plagas, but can they BREATHE underwater? Apparently they can. Then absolute worst part and horribly corny is these infected beings (I can't call them zombies since they are really not zombies) will RUSH up to you and attack and then almost come to a stop when they approach you. Oh and they like riding motorcycles too. Speaking of running, you can't reload when you are running. Your character comes to a COMPLETE stop to reload. Ugh, can it get any worse?? Yes, it can. Your partner Sheva's artificial intelligence is okay, but not the best. When she is armed with a gun and she runs out of bullets, for some reason she doesn't switch over to the grenades or other weapons. She will switch from gun to gun, but when she's out of ammo for those, she will go to the knife. You'll also find that she uses ammo like it's going out of style, you are always giving her bullets. I really wanted to like this game, but it's just tired and predictable. I laughed when the ""mystery"" character that saved Irving appeared. Why was he dressed like Batman? Didn't have the ears but it was close. Completely laughable. And they call this survival horror? Please, not a single thing was scary. The game play was boring and not even exciting. No sense of urgency or anything. I felt like I was going through the motions. All of their their previous games gave a sense of fun and excitement. Not this one. We've seen it all before in their other games. It's as if they remade RE 4 and changed a few things. Completely boring. The graphics and sound however is incredible. If you have an audiophile system with an HD TV, it looks and sounds awesome. But you know what they say, all style and substance. That accurately describes this game.

But maybe they should've pushed it back another year.

Ubisoft, determined to build a reputation similar to that of EA, just did not care when they were making this game. The other day, a friend asked me 'So, how's Unity?' and my reply was spot-on accurate, without me realizing what I was saying.

""It's a game about running around opening chests. Every now and then, you do a little bit of Assassin stuff.""

If you buy this game, and open your map, your heart will probably drop a bit at just how ugly and FULL your map is. No, it's not full of awesome things you can go do. It has, if I'm not mistaken, 294 chests to be opened, and that's not counting the ones that require you to play a giant, broken app on your phone, as well as use a giant, broken app that exists in the game itself (Initiates)

Don't get me wrong. The co-op, though glitchy as well as the rest of this rushed game, could revolutionize this series. I'm terrifed, though, that so many people are voicing how bad this game is, that Ubisoft will have typical company audacity to claim the multiplayer element is why people hate the game so much, and they'll do away with it completely... That would be bad. The only reason I still pick this game up and haven't resorted to selling it or passing it to someone else is because I can still play with my best friend. The (obviously) repetitive co-op missions and heists are irrelevant when it comes to the fact it's you and a friend now working together for a common goal. Apart from that? Give it another month, if you want this game. Maybe they'll have some issues worked out, maybe not, but I can almost promise you that the game will drop cost-wise by roughly $10-$25.

For a time, I played on Battle.net, and eventually collected some good items and had a fairly strong onlne character, but eventually I hated it (thanks to Blizzard's management and policies which did not allow you to host a non-P2P online game, and server lags from time to time). I loved playing D2 and LOD on my LAN though. No issues with hacking, because I and my group could control everything. I was foolish enough to buy and install D3 without realizing that there would be no LAN play, and no offline single player. So again, in D3 Blizzard made another major decision restricting players' freedom: internet only.

With D2, I had no problems with hacking or server lag, because I abandoned Battle.net. From my point of view, D3 is like the result of a doctor transplanting hemorrhoids to a healthy patient.

Let's review some of the arguments posted on this forum:

1) ""Things will be better after Blizzard resolves the server problems, and eventually there will be fewer users at any given time.""

For those who like online play and can accept off-and-on laggy servers or down servers at the worst possible moment, that is probably true. And Amazon ratings for D3 may go up. It is not true for me, because I have no desire to play on Battle.net. D3 will be a 1 star product from my point of view forever.

2) ""You should have known.""

That is true, but remember that many of us had been playing D2 for 12 years, and we were used to the freedom of being able to play offline. We did not imagine that Blizzard would remove that freedom in D3.

Imagine that you have been driving a certain brand of car for many years. This brand has built in ONSTAR and GPS, but up to now you could operate the car without being connected to those services. You go in and buy the latest model. The sales agent says that you have to have ONSTAR/GPS connected, but it's free. That's kind of strange, but you buy it anyway. Then you realize that you can't even drive the car without being connected. I realize that allowing a car to be returned is very different from allowing opened software to be returned, but I want Blizzard to realize that some of us will not trust them in the future. I will not ever buy from Blizzard again.

3) ""We can all blame the pirates.""

Let's see if I've got this straight. Blizzard could not control the hacking on battle.net, and so the solution is to force everyone onto battle.net, where the same hackers could attack the servers I am forced to use, and possibly attack the ports on my network that battle.net uses.

4) ""You are not rating the game, you are rating battle.net.""

The game IS battle.net now.

5) ""You clicked on the AGREE button when you installed it.""

If I had not agreed to the terms, I could not learn what it's like to play, and then you would say I don't know what I am talking about. Catch-22.

6) ""Online is the trend. It is inevitable.""

Against the computer, I had JJ Reddick and Turkoglu blocked 5 times apiece by Mourning and Shaq coming from the basket on what were wide open shots. There are also a ton of missed dunks, even Howard missed several. It is hard to pull of three's as well, since their guaranteed bricks.

The point guard and fatigue issue also sucks. The comp team never subs regardless of sliders. And their point guard scores 90% of the points. I played vs. Milwaukee and Maurice Williams scored practically every basket. This occured regardless of what level. Edit player is also a joke; I cannot edit the height, but at least I can edit the number and position. The rosters were supposed to be as of Aug. 24th, but where is Turiaf? And why is Battie a FA, he was never renounced or waived!

The press box angle is actually not bad. I dunno why Live insists on having their players pass in uncoventional ways, things like hook-shot style passes, behind the backs, even though the situation does not need those. The subsitution is also clunky; you can do the sub using the D-pad during a break in the action, but by the time you select the player you are bringing in, the game resumes leaving you with the same people on the court.

The timeouts are also timed, as in if you call a 20, there is a 20 second clock and so on. But you can always press a button to continue. The archs on the shots are off as well. Who shoots a high-archer in the paint? There are no retroes unless their unlockable. The courts look good but they don't have mascots, so it seems kinda dead. That should be the new name of this series. NBA DEAD 07.

1.0,False,"08 5, 2009",A1XX5797TIZT5Q,B000PS4X9G,D. Mok,"I've been playing Medal of Honor since the very first game on PlayStation.  This is the only game series I've played where each successive generation is worse than the last.

Where to start?  First of all, weapons.  I remember being able to use the Garand very effectively in Medal of Honor and Medal of Honor:  Underground (the latter is still the best game in the series, in my view).  Now, it is nearly useless because enemies run at the speed of light.  Single-shot rifles have next to no chance of hitting anybody unless you're very far away and they don't know you're there, or the enemy is just two feet in front of you.  And the enemies of this game have a horrible ""kamikaze god"" AI that will allow them to rush you, disappear out of the sight of your hyperactive camera, and knock you out while you're spraying bullets into them at point-blank range.  Let's say you have a good high perspective from which to snipe your enemies?  Your character will refuse to move to a place where you can actually, you know, see the enemies.  And if you happen to get a good spot sniping your enemies, your allies will gleefully rush to your spot and protect the enemies by blocking your scope right at the minute you press your trigger, or stick their big bodies right in your path of retreat so you can't move.  Artificial Intelligence, apparently, only apply to Italian and German enemies and not to Allied troops.

Apparently somebody at Electronic Arts confused himself with a filmmaker, because this game is chock full of visual tricks that make it a pain in the behind to play.  When you get hit by a bullet, the whole screen shakes and turns white so that you can't see who's hitting you.  When you use a sniper rifle, the scope is blurry for the first two seconds, so if you're being fired upon, you'll have to wait for about 15 bullets to finish hitting you before you can even start aiming.  When you're outnumbered, the game will experience lags so that you'll suddenly ""teleport"" to a few feet from where you were, completely disorienting you.  And here's one of the worst parts:  If you get a weapons upgrade within a level, say a grenade launcher for your rifle, the game will go into slow-motion for 10 seconds and -- get this -- automatically switch you to the new weapon without your consent.  Since these level-ups can happen while you're fighting 10 enemies in front of you, the slow-mo makes you a sitting duck because all commands, such as switching weapons or reloading, are disabled while the slow-mo happens.  Thanks a lot, EA, for forcing me to switch to grenades while I'm fighting close-quarters.

Every single ""cut scene"" in this game is in real time.  I've tried mashing every button available, but there's no way to skip them.  So, if you're replaying a mission to try to get better scores or weapons upgrades, you have to wait through all the movies; you can't just skip ahead.  This feature is moronic in the extreme.

But the part that infuriates me the most is the checkpoint system.  I've been replaying the lower levels of this game repeatedly, convinced that I just needed time to build up my strategies, get used to the game, improve my weapons, and maybe then Airborne would be more fun.  But the checkpoints in this game are completely screwed up.  Even with Autosave turned on, you can complete five out of six objectives in a level, get killed, and then suddenly you'd find yourself descending on a parachute again, losing 18 minutes of game progress.  What the?  I've tried everything, such as frequently using the ""Save Last Checkpoint"" feature, but this glitch seems to happen at random; on one game I'd be able to continue from the last completed objective, and then on another I'd be sent right back to the beginning again.  Nothing is worse than having to replay the same tired parts over and over while you try to get past that one super-hard section near the end, and that's exactly what this game does.

It saddens me to remember how much fun I used to have with the Medal of Honor games.  And the last three Medal of Honor games I've tried to play have all been too much eye candy and visual toys, no fun.",Worst Medal of Honor I've ever played.,1249430400,5,,

Utke,"OVERALL: This game is roughly equivalent to watching a movie, but in order for it to keep playing, you have to push a random button every 10 seconds.  There is no real game play to this game, and I found it extremely boring to play.

GAME PLAY: You wander around and when you see a dot, you push the joystick in the direction of the dot.  The character then opens a door or something like that.  At other points there are button pushing sequences, L1 pops up, you push L1, X flashes, you repeated push X, at other times the game goes into slow motion and you have to push the joystick in the direction the characters hands or feet are going in.  It can be difficult to determine which direction to push the joystick.
At other times you play as Aiden, which means you push L1 to lock on to random dots, then two more dots appear, you either push them down, or towards each other, and then some action happens.

STORY: I haven't yet completed this game and never will.  It is extremely boring to me.  There does seem to be a story, but it would be better told as a movie.  You don't really ""do"" anything in this game.  You seem to just meander around and react to button sequences.

GRAPHICS: The graphics were great, it almost looks like you're watching a movie.

CONTROL:  The left stick controls the characters movements, while the right stick controls where the character is looking.  However, it can be difficult to get the character to look in the direction you want.  Triangle switches between the two ""characters"".  Other than that, there really are no other set controls, you simply push the buttons that appear on the screen, or push the right joystick in the indicated direction.

The graphics and sound effects were too similar to Atari, yet it was released in 1990 so there was no excuse for those graphics (even for 8 bits). Back To The Future II and III is nothing but a relentless, distorted, puzzle game that is a Mario/Metroid rip off that has very little to do with the films (since when does Marty McFly comes across strange animals and plants in the movie?!). Finding items is a big chore and its virtually impossible to find more than half of them throughout the level and bonus stage. It's not as bad as the first game, but its still sucks. The developers should've gotten fired for making such a horrible game, because it was rushed without any thought or proper market research. Well what can you expect from LJN, who were the masters of distributing horrible NES video games made after blockbuster films (eg Jaws, A Nightmare on Elm Street, The Karate Kid, Who Framed Roger Rabbit...etc).  I'm glad that I only played it online (in the early 2000,s) instead of wasting $50+ on it back in the early 1990's. The game was so horrible that a different one was made for Super NES (that only represents the second movie) and it was a fun, adrenaline rushing pumped hit, run, and jump side scroller. There was only one problem, it was only released in Japan.

Plus, they are by LJN (except the Genesis BTTF3), so that can only mean a bad thing. The first BTTF game was a monstrosity in which you play as someone who is supposed to represent Marty, but doesn't look like him, shooting bowling balls, collecting clocks, and dodging bullies and hula-hoop girls.

Back to the Future 2 & 3 (not a game collection by the way, just to let you know) is better in some ways, but way worse in others. On one hand, the overused background music here sounds way better than that 1 and a half second loop of the first game's music. The game also plays better, as it's a hybrid of Mario and Metroid exploration/platforming.

On the other hand, the music is still overused, not making the game seem too great to begin with. And while the game does provide nice platforming, it fails on every bit of exploration. It is never easy to navigate yourself through all of these levels to find the items you need. You're supposed to send the items back to their time periods, but along the way, you'll have to find keys that open doors to items, play crappy bonus stages before reaching the items, unscramble words (Seriously? That's desperate...), and explore frustratingly throughout the game. And take notice that there are 30 items.

So, after explaining all of the basic things you have to do as you play the game, I'm pretty sure you wouldn't want to play the game. Even if you're a fan of exploration games like Metroid or Zelda, I may as well say good luck trying to find your way out of this unforgiving maze. Oh, yeah!

No big deal though since it had no scratches or visible issues, I downloaded the drivers from the manufacturers website. I wanted the gamepad because it said it had programmable buttons which turns out to be pretty disgusting to manage. The software to program the keys comes separate from the drivers. The manufacturer makes you download a 20mb installer (which extracts who knows how many mb's) which lets you set a lot of different controls for each button, but the UI is a total mess and it comes with the drop down list of all their keyboards / gamepads / mouse products. It also installs a bunch of drivers to software you DONT HAVE like the saitek keyboard. There's no way to selectively install just your gamepad software.

I am finding it hard to buy Madden each year, each year they get worse, but this one takes the cake.

1.0,True,"11 22, 2014",AXGPU830TXJ86,B00JUI8HJ4,Bitofinger,"So, to start off with a comparison, Dragon Age: Origins was one of the better games I have ever played; not so much for polished graphics or even exceptional game-play, but for the acting, witty dialogue, and compelling storyline.  The voices were extremely well done, and true-to-life believable.

Morrigan oozed potent sensuality with every word, but could turn on a dime with biting sarcasm.  Alistair's combination of loyalty, humor, and innocence were perfectly portrayed in his character's tone and timing.  Sten came off exceptionally well as the seemingly emotionless giant who was both teased to embarrassment by Leliana's coy playfulness, and secretly driven mad with desire by Morrigan's enthralling beauty.  Zevran was by far the quickest and easiest lay in the game, and his Hispanic accent and lover boy charm were in no way overacted.  Shale [spoiler alert] screamed ""flaming homosexual"" with every nuance of speech and every fretful concern over fashion, until you found out he was a she.

It seemed as if every character was portrayed with Oscar-potential acting.  The dialogue was witty even while being a bit juvenile; it had a sharp comedic edge, yet often a surprising sensibility.

Now for the horror that is Dragon Age: Inquisition.

Whenever I see an entertainment industry product so poorly done, I cannot help but ask myself, WHAT WERE THESE PEOPLE THINKING?

This is - BY FAR AND AWAY - the most artistically repulsive work of software fiction I've ever witnessed.  As other reviewers have noted, the shimmering, plasticine hair will drive you to absolute distraction, and make you want to pull out your own hair so you don't have to ever look at hair again.  HAIR, HAIR, HAIR!

Try to imagine - if you dare - melting a giant ball of plastic, placing the disgusting goop on top of someone's head so that it molds perfectly into a hair-like structure, and then, once it hardens to an immoveable, globulous mass, polishing the already bright helmet to the point that it outshines ALL other objects in the game, and that even the slightest movement bombards your eyes with a multitude of light flashes from the top of every character's head - EVEN THE BALD ONES!

I'm not sure how much worse it could get, but here's the ironic part: in some of the cut scenes, the hair is normal.  That tells me the shiny shine-shine is a disturbing attempt at some sort of extreme artistic device, but in truth it comes off as being derived from the never-ending war against consumer attention deficit.

Anyway, the rest of the game is equally atrocious in combat and looting mechanics, NPC interactions, story lines, dialogue, and, worst of all, voice acting.  These can all be summed up in two words: patently awful.  Not to mention that Inquisition is ABSOLUTELY an unfinished product, loaded with glitches.

I will add that you should take game's epilepsy warning seriously.  The game-play is so clunky (as other reviewers have said) and jerky that after playing about 8 hours over the course of 3 days, my vision seemed to be adversely affected.  I don't believe this is a frame rate issue, as I have a reasonably fast computer, and I tried all levels of graphic settings, to no avail.

It really never crossed my mind that the developers could $%^& things up THIS BAD.  What a fantastic disappointment.

Here are a few more examples of how this game is an abomination in every way.

Loading freeze:
So you start the game and get to the main menu.  You click on the top selection, ""Continue"", and nothing happens.  You click again.  You hit escape.  You close the annoying Origin DRM window.  You click the big red X (if in Windows platform, and in windowed mode). Doesn't matter - you're frozen.  This happens maybe once every five or six loads.  Task Manager is your only option.  By the way, you CANNOT play Inquisition without Origin up and running.  Yet another irritation, as if this game needed more.

Combat:
So you're getting slaughtered early in a battle, but you can't figure out why.  Three members of your party are all but dead, while a fourth remains healthy as a horse.  Well, that's because he or she got stuck a couple hundred yards away on a piece of rock about 1/8-inch tall.  Oops.

Looting:
So you go to pick up some loot.  You're a few feet away?  Okay, go walk over to it.  Still not close enough?  Stand on top of it.  Still can't pick it up?  Oh wait, that's because you're not FACING the loot.  Silly me, I didn't know my brain-dead character was spatially challenged.  Very much UNLIKE Origins, where, if you could click on it, your character would have the sense to WALK over to it, even from relatively far away, and turn THEMSELVES in the proper direction.  Imagine that. Dragon Age II made looting even easier, with an ultra fast keyboard shortcut.  Congratulations, BioWare; you've reversed almost 6 years of RPG progress, not to mention two major iterations of your own product.

Artwork:
So about 90% of the graphic design - everything from walls to grass to rock to skin to clothing - has almost as much shimmer as the disastrous hair.  At first glance, it looks as though the entire kingdom endured a recent hurricane, and everything is still wet.  I heard a calumnious rumor that the game's illustrators were orangutans hired at 5 bananas per day.  I can neither confirm nor deny its veracity.

Climbing and jumping:
So you're walking along, and there's a small hill you need to climb.  It's tiny, not even as high as your ankle.  But your character stubbornly refuses to move forward.  So you jump.  And.............................. that's it.  You hover in mid air with your knees up to your chest. Permanently.  You can look at the world around you (ooh, more shininess!!!).  You can switch characters.  You can look at your inventory, your map, your journal, etc.  Doesn't matter - the jumper stays jumped.  Hope you saved recently.

Ambient Dialogue:
So you're tooling along, minding your own business, when you hear prepubescent sparring between party members.

Iron Bull: ""Hey, that was some nice work back there, with that shield bashing.""

Cassandra: ""And you as well.""

Iron Bull: ""Are you as turned on as I am right now?""

Cassandra: ""Huh?""

Iron Bull: ""That's probably impossible anyway.""

Okay, so we're all back in 6th grade, and little Tommy gets really excited when the bigger boys make lewd comments about ""it"".  He doesn't understand these things yet, but they make him all hot and bothered.

The Xbox 360 comes in two versions: this bare-bones version, and a full-featured version that comes with a hard drive. The bare bones version is a little less expensive at first glance, but is more expensive in the long run.

For example: all games, and any use of Xbox Live, require some kind of memory storage. The bare-bones system does not come with any memory. You *have* to buy it seperately, which eats up 1/2 the price difference between the Core and the full version. Another example: the Core does not have high-def output cables. If you have a Core and you want to actually see the fancy graphics that the Xbox 360 is producing, you have to go out and buy a set of expensive cables--which eats the other half of the cost difference. If you want a wireless controller you have to buy that separately too, and now the Core is more expensive than the full version.

So I called Microsoft to see if I can have it repaired only to get the answer that my warranty had expired mere days ago.  They did however offer to repair the system for half the price of a brand new system ($100 the new xbox 360 being released in a month retails at $199) with no mention of an upgraded warranty after this one would have gotten fixed.  Naturally I decided to decline especially since I had a backup system upstairs (my fiancee's).  I got to play one game for about a half hour and decided to switch to a different game, low and behold a second system broken in one day, this time the drive door would not open, not to worry this system was made later and should still be under warranty right?

1.0,True,"03 14, 2013",ASF0VCHHN0XMG,B007FTE2VW,Charlie Foxtrot,"I've been a die hard Sim City fan since the beginning, and I have to say, I'm really disappointed in EA and Maxis' latest offering.

I luckily did not have any of the server connection issues others had. But even without those problems, the game has several flaws that ruin it for me. It seems obvious that EA's ham fisted DRM and DLC approach to game building is taking over, as right out of the box you feel like you are missing major content that should have been included in the $60 ""Limited Edition"".

The maps are TINY! I mean, picture the smallest map size in SC4, cut it in half, and that's about the size of the maps you get in Sim City. I laugh browsing through the achievements; some of them, like reach 1,000,000 population, I can't even see how it would be possible. I've already completely filled my map area and I barely have 15,000 people. If you were hoping for SC4 style gameplay, with massive cities and connected suburbs, you can forget it. Even Cities XL seemed to do this aspect of the game better than Sim City.

The road building is better, but they left out some key features, like filler tiles and steep grade bases for many buildings, which leave your cities looking glitchy and with empty areas around zones. It would be nice if they had some filler tiles that you could use to fill in dead space like in Cities XL. Also, the building variety is terrible, and it doesn't seem like there are any options for user created content like there was in SC4, so I'm guessing you'll just be building the same city over and over again until you just get tired of the game in a month. Although, I can bet EA will be adding ""content"" like buildings later and charging you an arm and a leg for the ""privilege"" like they've done on other Sim titles of late.

The always on DRM internet connection requirement really sucks. If you enjoyed playing SC4 while traveling, you can pretty much forget it. Sim City is supposed to be a solo activity. I can understand that some people like the multiplayer addition, but to require always on connection for everyone is just plain stupid.

This is just the tip of the iceberg. The point is, if you like The Sims, Cities XL, or Sim City Societies, you'll probably like this version as well. But if your hoping for an updated version of SC4, you'll be very disappointed, just like I am.

(EDIT) 3/17/13

OK, so after playing for a couple weeks, I've come across yet another major flaw. So the game's always on connection means that your game saves are stored to the server or something, and the game makers in all of their wisdom have decided that you don't need an option to save the game on your own, and that it will save it for you. It's hard to click on that ""quit"" button without hitting save first, your brain is telling you not to trust the game to save your work for you, but oh well, it works, right?

Well, no, it doesn't work. Lately (about 60% of the time) I've been getting an error message that the game is not ""processing correctly"" and asking if I want to roll my city back to a stable point, or abandon the city completely. So the big project I've been working on for the last two hours is now completely gone and I'm back to where I was when I started today. If only I had a save option so I could save my work. Thanks guys, that's quite a ""feature"".

The psychic powers are so overwhelming they feel like cheats.  With several of the powers you can clear the entire screen of baddies once every two seconds or so for the entire game so the only way to have fun is to intentionally weaken yourself.  The weapons are unsatisfying and a confusing chore to select.

The best thing about the ""flick targeting system"" is that you can ignore it.  The baddies come in Serious Sam type waves to be mowed down by your double guns plus smart-bomb psychic powers, so precise targeting is pretty silly.  Navigating your character is frustrating. You can stand next to a platform you're supposed to grab onto and jump many times before your hands latch on to the edge.  I died from that and the buggy jump controls more than from fighting the bad guys.

About half the sound effects are flat out missing, so many actions have little impact. Overall the game feels very untested and buggy.

Problems with PvE:
The grind is real.

Problems with WvW:
There isn't even any attempt at balance; even though there is balance data from PvP, its not incorporated, because WvW is so broken that no amount of balance would help. Using PvE equipment puts newer players at a disadvantage. Its a deterrent to the new players that we should be trying to bring into the game.
Its also a deterrent to long time players who are trying to craft the top gear; you're forced into a game mode that is mind-numbingly awful. It could be argued that the purpose for this is to provide new targets for WvW players to prey upon.
Running in groups is nothing more than a numbers game where the large group rolls over the small group.
Classes that can engage/disengage at will, like theives and mesmers can roam with impunity. If they start losing a fight, they just leave, and come back after a moment. That kind of non-stop harassment sucks away all the possibility for enjoyment. There isn't a way to escape or deliver a finishing blow against these classes.
My guild mates are all on different servers, so the guild missions are completely useless for us - we can't play together in WvW.

I've listed the top offending errors below:

(1) Environmental errors: There was a section in the first level where I moved behind a fence. I came to the end of the fence but couldn't move past it, even though nothing was blocking my path. I had to loop all the way back and go around. This is a pretty basic error, and yet quality testing missed it - not a good sign.

(2) Enemy detection errors: I was fighting a slew of enemies on the second level and before I could advance further, I had to eliminate all the ground troops. There was one left on my radar and I flew down to find he was....under the concrete. Yes, this enemy somehow fell UNDER THE CONCRETE. I had to reset and start the level all over again.

(3) Poor targeting system: The only way I could shoot a target is if the crosshairs were centered on an enemy at that specific moment. That means if Iron Man was running, flying, or dodging, it's pretty likely that my laser blasts or missiles would miss the target.

(4) Hyper-sensitive flight system: The flight controls operate on a hair trigger. If I pressed the hover button too hard, Iron Man shot straight up. If I pressed the hover button too lightly, he dropped like a stone. When I hit the flight button, Iron Man shot forward at Ludicrous Speed - and I couldn't slow down. At all.

In a nutshell, I spent most of my game time flying around at breakneck speed with little control, trying not to slam into buildings, attempting to hit multiple enemies with a poor weapons system, while trying to break a time limit.

Macomber,"You know when I played through mass effect 1 and 2 and gearing up for 3 I was thinking that this game trilogy could be one that would make record books and leave a mark in gaming history. I waited a little bit on Mass effect 3 when it came out for a price drop maybe and let all the bugs and problems to be ironed out. Well it didn't take long for me to hear the rumors of the bad ending and the complaints. I have heard the majority of people give their ""opinion"" on alot of games and I never agreed with them. So when I heard the ending was bad I took it to heart but thought that there couldn't be anything bad enough to ruin this saga........I was so wrong....

I won't ruin the ending, but let me just say that if you heard the ending was bad from a friend or someone and heard all the bad rumors, believe them 100%. All your hopes and dreams for the mass effect trilogy will go up in smoke in the last few minutes of the game. This damage to the ending and the expectations is so great, that you very well may not even sleep at night, lol. Mass effect 3 in my opinion cannot be reviewed without dragging 1 and 2 into the mix. Why? Because unlike some other games, the Mass effect trilogy is based on your choices and the choices that you make carry on. Its a long story that is somewhat molded by your choices. But Bioware didn't seem to take that into consideration near the end of Mass effect 3. I don't care about how great Mass effect 3's graphics are or the special effects. Or even the increased difficulty I longed for. This game ruined Mass Effect 1 and 2 then ultimately offed whatever was left in the franchise.

I am sorry there is no excuse for this Bioware, and I hope listen to your fans. You honestly have lost alot of respect from me and your ability to make a good rpg saga such as Mass effect. Making mass effect 4 while keeping Mass Effect 3's ending the way it is won't fly with me. You lost a customer, and I am not the kind of person who says stuf like that. I am not sure if you were on some bad medication when you wrote the ending or what, but since you refuse to listen to fans, you have now alienated yourself. I could care less about your new ideas for Mass Effect 4. You get a score on Amazon of 1, and wish I could give less. You promised a rpg of choices and instead you gave us something that wasn't even of this world.

Everyone knows about the server problems.  I actually got on, early on release day, and had a fun singleplayer experience learning about curvy roads and getting frustrated at the tiny size of your allowed city footprint.  Now it's a 45 minute exercise to get on, and even odds whether you stay on or not.  Assume that'll eventually be fixed - it's not the source of most of my frustration, but it makes it a one-star game this week.

The graphics are beautiful and mainly why the game gets 2 stars from me instead of 1.  They are just gorgeous - at least the city rendering.  Many of the building models have generic signage - ""Low Cost Apartments,"" ""Mid Cost Business,"" I mean, come on, that was not intended.  Those models weren't ready to be released to the public.  But you can zoom down to street level and drive down the street of your city with the camera at about the height of a streetlight and just get a feel for what it must be like to live, walk, drive and work there, and it looks and feels like a real city, and that's just awesome.

Much has been made - by Maxis - of the fact that every single Sim is persistently simulated.  Who cares?  This part of the game is not interesting.  I clicked on about 50 Sims and vehicles and never saw anything that interested me.  Pathing and traffic are especially stupid; 100% of vehicles will ignore a highest-density road in favor of a dirt path if the highest-density road is 0.01% longer.  That's stupid.  Unfortunately, all the simulation that I bothered to investigate is that stupid.  And the obsession with ploppables and sewage is frankly disturbing; if the rest of the game had had the same level of obsessive detail as the sewage simulation, I think it'd actually be a six star game.  Sadly for the star count in this review, I don't care that much about sewage.

You can't run the game at all without pinging the servers repeatedly; you can't save a game, Origin (EA's stupid Steam clone) decides what gets saved and what you are permitted to resume; and you can't revert to prior if you do something dumb and wreck your city.  These are choices made by EA to force you to use Origin and to prevent pirates from playing.  They are stupid choices.

Also, did you know you were buying a game lease from Amazon, not a copy of a game?  It's in the first paragraph of the EULA; you agree that you are allowed to play your leased game until EA says you are not allowed to play it any more, or until you want to uninstall it.  Period.  I don't know about that; I'm not Richard Stallman but I think this is a little ridiculous.  If EA didn't make a big deal about it, maybe I wouldn't; but their servers are busted and they can't even make their stupid idea of a game lease WORK.  That's a big deal, it's a big deal EA made, and they now have to eat the fruits of their stupidity, which is the fact that they are getting panned across the entire globe for something that probably half the gamers in the world were ready to get totally excited about.

I expect EA to roll out updates that will fix some of the above; I doubt the superficial quality of the simulation will get fixed, and that's too bad.  I never played SC4, so I find that my experience with this version of SimCity has encouraged me to boot up Steam and buy a copy of it for $19.95.

Gaijin's previous flight combat entry, IL2 Sturmovik: Birds of Prey was an engaging, fun, harrowing air combat experience that could be adjusted to suit the player's taste.  No such luck here.

While the game strives for realism, it straddles the line of believability.  On one hand, you have pretty cool effects, like the turret camera views that show enhanced zooms and thermal imaging views, and some good sound.  On the other, you have subpar graphics, mediocre explosions, and absolutely horrible voice acting that attempts to cram in as many ethnicities at once, and in doing so, actually does them injustice (in the first two missions alone, you're introduced to an Irish guy, a Chinese guy, a cockney guy and a British chick.)  Frankly, I didn't get it.

All of that I can handle.  What killed it for me was, plain and simple, the controls.  This threw me off the most...again, in IL2, you are made to go through the paces of flying an airplane, gradually introducing all aspects of air combat until you're comfortable.  Controls could be adjusted to suit anyone, from arcade jockeys to aces.  No such luck here.  Considering that a helicopter is far more advanced to fly than an airplane, I settled in for what I hoped to be a long training excersise, and instead got a ten-minute crash course, almost literally.

The game eschews all previous helicopter-style control schemes from all previous games that ever had helicopters in it in favor of one rigid, almost inflexible setting.  Anyone who expected the thrilling zoom-and-boom of Mercenaries or any other arcade-style flight scheme had better look elsewhere.  The question is, why?  Why would Gaijin give all of their other air combat games simpler control schemes except for this one, one that needed it the most?

I'm no stranger to air combat games, but within an hour, this game had me frustrated...and bored.  The graphics have taken a serious step down on this one, and it shows.

I realize that lots of people like this game, and I can see why.  I just can't believe that this was even close to Gaijin's best effort.  I know, because I've seen it...and it didn't look, or play, anything like this.",Simply not fun...,1303516800,4,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

Furthermore, because of the defective software, every time you resume your computer from standby, or restart, the DPI setting will be **different** than you left it last, and you'll find the mouse is either way too sensitive, or not sensitive enough. If you try pressing the DPI up buttons on the mouse, nothing will happen until you open the actual software - **even if the software is running in the background**. This is so annoying; I literally smash my mouse against the desk. The buttons on the side of the mouse, used for back/forward are more of a nuissance than anything. I find myself constantly pressing them by accident and navigating away from my webpage. They cannot be disabled, even with the software.

I can also say the mouse is not comfortable in your hand with prolonged or even intermittent use. The left and right mouse buttons only work if you press them at the very top part of the mouse- this puts a lot of strain on your wrist and forewarm. I much prefer the cheapo lenovo mouses we have where I work. I also have frequent issues with this mouse on my USB ports.. it only seems to work on certain USB ports at certain times, even with the drivers and software installed. Sometimes when I turn on my computer, the mouse isn't even lighting up and I have to plug it into another port. All in all, this mouse is horrible. It's terrible for gaming because it's too big and too uncomfortable, and it's impossible to get the DPI setting just right.

I had to start Final Fantasy Tactics over a few times just because I couldn't make the right armies. Certain battles, like the one with that Wiegraf guy, were downright frustrating. But I think they were necessary, because they made the game feel that much more epic.

About the bad parts of the game... This game doesn't seem to challenge me in the least. As the game progresses you get more and more genma stones. This is fine, just you don't get enough souls to upgrade the equipment you make. The whole thing about the game is you are suppose to pick what kind of characters you like and give them cool looking armor. There are not enough varities of armor and weaponry to make the genma stone thing seem rewarding.

What's good? Well, the game is simple enough that small decisions will not ruin you. In Final Fantasy Tactics, attacking someone's side rather than their back can cost you the game. In Onimusha Tactics, attacking a monster's side is like attacking his front or back. It's the same thing. The characters are diverse, yet there is little to no character developement. Honestly? I don't think I care anymore as I've seen practically every character possible known to man. I've seen the strong silent type, the lone vagrant, and the cautious samurai. At times I get annoyed with the game because it seems like every other battle, a new character is thrown into my party and I don't even want to know the person. Sometime, certain characters who you forgot were in your party will say a line like, ""This land is fertile, it will be the perfect battleground."" And you will have to remember how that guy got in your party. The thing is though, I've come to expect cliches, and I'm glad that I don't need to play with characters I don't care about.

And now for the ugly... You can't backtrack. Once you visit a location you are not going to go there again. There are no towns. If you want to earn some extra souls, forget it. You can't even customize equipment outside of battle. If you want to customize your characters, you have to do it when you are picking them for the next battle. Even worst, some of the characters in your party look cool, but have terrible movement rates. I'd love to play with Ekei, but he barely moves across the map compared to my other characters. I'd also love to play with that ninja girl, but she does so little damage and has so little health that she wastes space. The one thing that annoys me more than anything is the issen command. Occasionaly your character will get issen. This this basically takes the place of the ""done"" command. You can move around but you can't do any commands other than that. The whole premise of issen is that you set it up, and, during the enemy's turn, if a monster attacks you, you will counter it. This doesn't work if the monster uses a special move. The problem is, THE MONSTERS ALWAYS USE THEIR SPECIAL MOVES! Bosses have like 200  special points, and their special moves consume 5 points. Throughout the entire game, I can only remember having a successful issen 2 times. TWO TIMES! One was during the training, and the second was when I was messing around in the Phantom Realm against level 5 monsters. The Phantom Realm is a place where you can try to progress through various floors(like the Onimusha games on playstation) without healing. It would be great, but you have to fight through the crappy levels each time you play it, and those take a while, even though they are easy.

This review is of the game.
I loved NWN 1.
This sequel was put together by a different team and feels almost like an entirely different game.

It adds more of the AD&D 3.5 edition rules to the core and that is welcome.

The graphics are kind of a problem - not because of the quality, but rather because of the implementation.  This game came out at a transitional time for 3D engines and the graphics are NOT optimized for running well ... on any machine really.  If you update the game or install the expansion packs it will help, as the initial launch provide a wave of negative reviews that the developers tried to fix.  Once patched it does look and play better, but it doesn't look as good as some games that came out at the same time and it doesn't run as well as games that came out later.

Adding to the confusion is the COMPLETELY different design and style of the game visuals.
The hotkeys (thankfully) are in the same general spots - which has saved me - because the tutorial does not help you with how to actually play the game.  So much has changed from NWN that it was essentially learning a completely new game.  Oddly its just the layouts and design that have changed.  Because this is based on AD&D the gameplay is basically the same - real time or pause and command strategy in a turn based RPG system - the WAY the game works is nearly identical to NWN but all of the menus, camera controls, player controls, everything the player SEES has been drastically changed.

The story and writing are good, and there is a LOT of story.  So people who enjoy story driven RPG will enjoy the game.  The Character customization is unparalleled (due to it's use of AD&D rules).  But the main story is fairly linear.  There are custom story lines available in abundance online for free so this is not an issue.

My biggest gripe:  The Graphics.

EDIT:  I'm continuing to have graphics problems.  Most of the issues I'm encountering are well documented on the internet.  Most notably - If you have more than 1 core/cpu the game will still only use 1 core.  This causes massive FPS issues on newer machines ... which is pretty ridiculous given that at the time the game was made Multiple Cores wasn't new or all that uncommon. The game also experiences timing clock issues if your Computer has been running for more than a few hours.  (A game that you have to reboot your OS to play ... what is this 1987?!?!

Given all of the issues I can't really recommend this game to anyone.  (Unless you have a vintage 2007 Gaming Rig ... this will probably run fine on it.)

2.0,False,"10 17, 2010",A11JVRGUM4KIMB,B001ENPDJA,Matt,"If you are curious how this keypad compares to the Xbox 360's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chatpad/dp/B000UN3UDQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chatpad</a>, keep reading as I will be basing most of my review on comparing the two, even though each is for a specific system.

Both were great ideas, but somehow the PS3 keypad falls short of the Chatpad in nearly every department. The most important being the location...who decided that the keypad had to be on ""top"" of the controller? Whoever it was made the biggest mistake for such a device. I suppose it's possible that the attachment simply wouldn't have functioned properly or been comfortable located on the bottom, but I believe that it could have been done. This alone is reason enough not to buy this if you can use a USB keyboard instead. In my case, this isn't really an option. The bottom line here is that it's simply not comfortable to type on at any point. Most people will have to adjust their grip on the controller in order to use the keypad, which is not something they should have to do. It's almost better to keep the keypad unattached from the controller and use it as a separate device. Ultimately, I suppose there was some big reason why they had to make it for the top of the controller - if not, this was a HUGE oversight.

Aside from that major flaw, the keypad attaches to the controller well and looks pretty good for what it is. It doesn't add much weight and allows easy access to all buttons and ports you would have without it. The ""pass-through"" buttons (ie: the PS button on the keypad simply presses the PS button on the controller) feel a little cheap and somewhat uncomfortable, in my opinion - the original Start and Select buttons are rubbery, while the ones on the keypad are plastic. They are also raised higher for obvious reasons, which means you'll need to adjust what you've been used to since the PSX. Also, I think a nice layer of rubber between the pass-through buttons and the 'real' ones would help to make them feel more ""solid,"" if that makes sense.

So PS3 keypad location = top of controller; 360 Chatpad = bottom of controller. I think anyone who has used both will agree that the Chatpad is much more convenient to access quickly and more comfortable overall.

Another big thing the Chatpad did right was have backlighting for the keys. I didn't really think this would be a big deal, but I find that I'm usually playing games in dim lighting, so the off-white lettering on black plastic makes it near impossible to see what you're typing in such lighting conditions. Obviously, this makes it near useless, unless you're just good at typing on such a device. Since I don't do that much typing on the PS3, I have yet to get comfortable enough with typing that I don't have to look at what I'm doing.

So PS3 keypad = no key backlighting; 360 Chatpad = backlit keys. A seemingly simple feature becomes a huge oversight for the keypad.

The touchpad, while a neat idea, is near useless. I only tried it for a few moments in the browser and, since you're running your finger over the buttons, the cursor just kind of jumps around everywhere - it's not easy to make it move in any kind of a straight line. If you've ever had a piece of hair stuck on the underside of a optical mouse, think of it kind of like that, though the cursor doesn't skip around quite as much. I suppose it might be good for someone who can't get used to browsing with the analog sticks, but I doubt I'll ever use it again.

So PS3 keypad = touchpad; 360 Chatpad = no touchpad or anything like it. This doesn't really make Chatpad ""better"" or the Keypad ""worse"" but I doubt many people will use it for long - it's simply a failed feature. How much production costs could be save by removing this feature? Could we have had backlighting instead? The world may never know.

In the end, it's not a bad accessory to have. However, I believe the retail price to be way too much - especially when compared to the 360's Chatpad, which is almost half the price. If you can find a good deal on this, go for it, but heed the consistent cons throughout these reviews and decide how important they are to you. My wager would be that if you've never used the Chatpad, you might be okay with most of the cons here. If you have, however, prepared to be very disappointed, especially when you compare what you paid for your chatpad to what you'll pay for this.

If I could do it over again, I'd research the third party keypads more.

So we got a PS4 and immediately bought this game as my husband and I are both huge horror fans, and quite honestly, we got swept up in all the praise this game got in the reviews here. (I can't believe someone actually said this game was one of the best gaming experiences they ever had...ever hear of Uncharted? Or any other real game?)

We are only on Chapter 7 and are throwing in the towel.

This game, or interactive movie, rather, is just too damn boring. (Game OR movie, it is seriously lacking the element of F-U-N!)
GAMES are meant to be played, and MOVIES are meant to be watched.
With this, you get a bad mix of very little play, and too much watch.
There were so many times where I was caught off guard when I was prompted to do something, or make a quick decision, because I forgot I was even holding a controller. I was so zoned out after doing nothing but walking or watching cut scenes, I had actually forgotten there are those moments when you do need to act on something. (And by ""act"" I mean just quickly hitting whatever button the game tells you to before time runs out. Wee!)

Knowing that our decisions change how the game plays out had me originally thinking that we'd be getting some real bang for our buck in replay-ability. But then I found myself wondering, ""Can I really ever see myself putting this game back in and sitting through this crap all over again?""
Also on that note, there are several instances of pointless decision making where no matter what selection you make, the outcome is the same. For instance: Agree to go to the fire tower? Or disagree and insist we go back to the lodge? Select to go back to the lodge and you STILL get talked into going to the fire tower. What is the point?! Is it really going to make a difference in the story down the road? I'll never know because I accidentally got that character killed when I failed to hit a button in time (see above).

When we played late one night, and BOTH fell asleep during the game, we knew it was over for us. Because really...who on earth has ever heard of someone falling asleep during a horror game?

I really do have to agree with another reviewer that stated that this game is more like a chore to get through. And that, my friend, is never good when you're talking about a game.

We'll stick with games that actually allow you to PLAY, thank you very much.

If you want a TRUE horror game, play Evil Within (super scary and intense). Or bust out your PS3 and play the Silent Hill games or Resident Evil.

There has been a trend recently to reverse the gamist influence of tabletop role-playing games on their video game counterparts.  Consoles don't lend themselves well to complex rules systems and designers find their beautifully rendered enemies disrupted by floating hit point numbers over their heads.  In response, Alone in the Dark goes full simulationist - forget the rules, this is all about horror!

And so Alone in the Dark, like Silent Hill, starts out in media res. You learn to play as you go by ferociously clicking buttons to blink your eyes so you can see straight.  You play an amnesiac anti-hero with a secret connection to a certain stone held by a certain priest.  A bald villain, named Crowley (yet another mystical foe named after Aleister Crowley, the occultist), marches you to your doom until he is disrupted by something even scarier: extradimensional tears in the fabric of reality.

Thing is, extradimensional tears aren't all that scary.  The entity that is in charge enjoys possessing hot chicks and growling in a deep voice, instantly rendering the villain rather mundane. Those looking for the Cthulhu Mythos-inspired connection that suffused the original Alone in the Dark will find the chatty archnemesis lacking.

What Alone in the Dark does very well is completely conceal the rules from the player.  Our hero can only carry so many items in his jacket - no unlimited, unrealistic inventory here!  He can swing weapons or even light them on fire, and the fire mechanics allow him to do everything from blast explosive bottles out of the air to pouring flammable liquid on his bullets so they shoot fire.  Realistic, huh?

There are no hit points, no health meters, and not much in the way of rules.  What Alone in the Dark lacks in gamist structure it makes up for in narrativist railroading, with a capital R.

Alone in the Dark is hellbent on telling a story, and the developers just happen to drag the player along for the ride.  It even has a function to allow you to skip any scene, with a brief montage at the beginning of each replay to describe what happened ""previously, in Alone in the Dark..."" I played a car chase sequence fifty times before I gave up. I ran around with a flashlight trying to make some black goo not eat me (repeatedly watching the starting sequence of a sewer worker swearing effusively before being eaten) thirty times before I gave up. I teetered inside a precariously balanced bus on the edge of the cliff dozens of times before the game crashed.

And so we have Alone in the Dark's problem - if you want to make a game all about story, it better be a good story.  Alone in the Dark provides absolutely no guidance as to what to do next.  You are guaranteed to die over and over until you figure it out, which renders any interesting cut scene or curious camera angle meaningless after the fifth time.  The game is a buggy mess too.  It crashes constantly; at one point, a villain just stood there and let me whack at him to no effect. Maybe he felt bad for me.

Alone in the Dark tries hard, but like an action blockbuster, it has no interesting story to tell.  With stereotypical villains, enemies that aren't scary, frustrating camera angles, and a railroading plot that will have you tearing your hair out, Alone in the Dark will leave players alone in the dark.",Leaves players in the dark,1290643200,3,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

To those people, lay off the kool-aid and try not to ride the PR train next time. Or at least become a shill and get payed while doing so.

Upon completing this game, I was very disappointed by it.
First, while previous RE games were spooky and had great ""zombie"" creepiness(REmake anyone?) this one can be best summarized as black men with blood shot eyes riding motorcycles. What happened to this series?

Whoever came up with the ""daylight horror"" during preproduction meetings at Capcom should have his head examichopped off. There are no scares, no horror atmosphere worthy of Resident Evil name. The entire franchise has become a derivative action slugfest. Some people might say this shift kinda started with RE4, sure, but RE5 pretty much goes way past it and feels like nothing more than House of the Dead game, with the rails turned off accompanied by a slower, less responsive pointing laser. Kick the door in, pop some infected Africans, rinse and repeat.
Game is extremely linear, there is no exploration, no backtracking to unlock previous areas with newly acquired toys. Even the shock value is pretty much gone, rest in pieces window jumping canines. All you do is mow down very slow moving infected villagers that act more like practice dummies than a threat. They ride motorcycles and even use conventional weapons near the end of the game. Isn't there some unspoken rule zombies don't do that written somewhere. What, they're not zombies anymore? Then what are you calling this a RE game for. Might as well go with nazi vampires for next one. Head hurts.

Resident Evil worked Capcom(REmake), you tried to fix what wasn't broken(RE4), and you broke it(RE5). It only took time to realize it.

Ok, so it's not a remarkable survival horror game, neither was RE4 but that was a good action game. Back in 2005.
Resident Evil 5 is a bad(dated?) action game. It tries to copy RE4 and slap a new paint job on it, but 4 years have passed. Not being able to move and shoot is unacceptable in 2009 for an action game. It works in survival horror adventure games, in which you spend more time anticipating the combat encounters than the actual combat, AND where action isn't the focus of the game. It doesn't work in an action game. It never did, and the moment the competition arrived it showed how outdated RE4 controls truly were. No, don't kid yourself fanboys, this game is in the same genre as Gears of Wars and Dead Space - a behind the shoulder action game. The problem is both these already released games control and are designed much better than what Capcom just spew out. If that wasn't insulting enough, GeoW2 can be more creepy at times than RE5 and it controls better too! I'm not even going to talk about Dead Space, which blew everyones mind how well it turned out. A game from EA no less /facepalm. Maybe, just maybe, there is hope for System Shock 3.

Terrible tank controls, restrictive movement, slow aiming controls, awful cover implementation.

Moving on, the aggressiveness of the enemies - or lack thereof. I've lost count the number of times a mob of enemies run up to me, then sloooowly started to circle around me waiting to be shot down one by one. This isn't anything new, RE4 had the same ridiculous mechanic. Like the game is trying to tell you both movement and aiming controls are implemented the wrong way, so we have to make the enemies that look at you for the most part, while you slowly, in stationary position, aim for the head shots. Let's face it, if the zombies from Left 4 Dead or the mutated freaks from Dead Space showed up you would never make it past the first level with these controls. Sure, there are some mini bosses which are a step up in the right direction, but they're either so slow you can run circles around them(executioner) or so trivial(chainsaw guy) it makes no difference. Then again, we get others later on that wouldn't be amiss in a railgun game where you don't even need to move, and let's not forget the ever annoying quick time events, hope you don't mind those.

It gets better! Not only are the controls terrible, you are stuck with an African co-op partner(skin tone not too black, just enough not to be white) who is terrible at ammo/health items conservation. Combined that with a limited inventory and that you can't drop items to pick up later if you're full, and you end up with an annoying micro management side game that is well past outstaying its welcome by the time you fly off in the chopper. Also a helpful hint, watch her ammo, she sprays it like they kidnapped her poodle and beat it in a sack while making her watch.
Thankfully, if you play online and allow another person to control her rather than ai this fairs much better. Then again, if you want to play co-op zombie action game with other people, I suggest you look into Left 4 Dead.

Only redeeming quality this game has? It looks and sounds OUTSTANDING. I wouldn't be surprised if Capcom has legions of talented artists chained to their desks working them 24/7.

Very enjoyable as far as the gunplay is concerned. Tight controls coupled with a fun array of weaponry is sure to delight any shooter fan. With sharp-looking graphics and good sound, the action is non-stop. But nearly everything else about the game is one big pile of Fail.

Story: What story? Early COD games had really interesting narratives. Even the first Modern Warfare had an entertaining story - missions progressed in a sensible manner. Too much of Modern Warfare 2's mission progression relies on leaps of faith - urging the player to accept one set-piece action sequence after the other for the sake of blowing shhtuff up. It is worth repeating that the set-pieces aren't necessarily bad! I liked the locales and the action, but JEEBUS gimme a coherent story. Peering underneath the mess at the core storyline you get the sense that the writers had a decent Tom Clancy-ish concept, but either they were under too much pressure from the publisher to rush the product out the door or they all collectively suffered from the Lucas Effect. By the Lucas Effect I mean that they realized Modern Warfare 2 was to the other Call of Duty games what the Star Wars prequels were to the original trilogy; You could put out garbage and still make enough money to rival a small nation's GDP. Great job with the marketing Activision. Seriously.

Gameplay: Third time repeating myself, but its not that bad. While the controls and core mechanics all feel very refined - all the other elements do not come together well enough for me to write home about. Its the same old stuff under the same old engine (more on this later). a mad rush of enemies - you'll hug the ground or the nearest cover like white on rice. One thing IW: its been almost 7 years since we first realized that you guys love grenades - time to tone it down a little.

Graphics/Game Engine: They're quite good! Actually there are three aspects which are flawless: the lighting/shaders, animation/motion-capture and the incredible texture work. While all this is well and good, I've come to expect more and more out of shooters ever since Crysis - especially where physics is concerned. MW2 feels too static and too on-the rails in certain parts. With all the firepower we get to lug around, it'd be nice to see some permanent and procedurally-generated destruction. And gibs. Gibs are good.

Sound: PHENOMENAL! with a good surround system, this game is an orchaestral ballet of whizzing bullets and tense radio chatter. The music is a step below what Modern Warfare offered, but in no way is it bad. The music ranges from dramatic action suites to truly emotional notes - especially when you witness things like Washington DC en flambe.

Multiplayer: This is where the game fails completely - and I'm repeating what many others have already written about. For a game whose campaign is over in a ludicrous 4 to 5 hours, you expect a tonne from the multiplayer. At least an experience that rivals the original, even if it doesn't surpass it. Sadly, with the numerous restrictions and downgrades, MW2 will just leave you angry that you spent 60 dollars on it. For the PC that is unjustified. Not when fantastic games like Dragon Age Origins that can easily take 75 hours to finish are available for about 39.99. Okay so I'm comparing apples to oranges. If multilplayer is your thing, do yourself a favor and either wait for Bad Company 2 (which looks much more promising) or grab a copy of Left 4 Dead 2, which is oodles of fun.

Bottom line: I hope this is a misstep that Infinity Ward corrects with the inevitable Modern Warfare 3. They've made some remarkable shooters in the past. For 60 bucks I, at the very least, expect a campaign that lasts longer and a multiplayer component that doesn't feel like a downgrade. Also, they need to work on the story.

A 244 page script and an unprecedented 60 minutes of original cinematic footage was produced so gamers and movie watchers alike could learn the story of Ghost and Niobe (played by Anthony Wong and Jada Pinkett Smith.)  Their time on the big screen was limited, but their experiences in the game supplement the Matrix story and fill in gaps the movie left out.  The concept is pure genius, but the finished product ends up a failure because it's just not fun to play.
From the start of the game, you get this unnerving feeling that developer Shiny Entertainment was in over their head.  The game engine itself has sub-par graphics considering its high system requirements and the number of bugs are atrocious (more on that later.)  I knock off another star for the bloated 3.6 gigs of hard drive space this game requires.  Running music and cutscenes off the CD's could have saved a lot of space, but we're not given this option.  Hard drives are cheap, but this is ridiculous.
After spending the half-hour/hour necessary to dump this behemoth on your hard drive, you'll find yourself starting out watching a movie clip involving Ghost, Niobe, and their cynical ship dwelling sidekick Sparks.  The clips are faithful to the movie and, to their credit, Shiny added well done computer animated cutscenes of their own.  Your first mission involves infiltrating a post office to pick up an important package.  From this point, Sparks whines about the difficulty of the mission (as he does throughout the game), you choose whether you want to be Ghost or Niobe, and the game begins.
As you proceed through the post office, prompts flash on the screen which provide ""tips"" on performing various functions such as controlling character movement and performing special fighting moves.  It would have been nice to simply hit a function key instead of Esc, select option, scroll down, select tip, etc... An extremely linear game, you're subjected to following a green arrow at the top of the screen which points which direction you should be headed, punching and kicking cops and security guards along the way.  After reading twenty tips and punching and kicking 100 security guards as you follow your little green arrow, you find you have returned right back where you started.  In fact, you'll run in circles three times just to complete the first level.  In another level, you run from one end of a level to another to flip a switch and turn a conveyor belt on.  Halfway back, you get a prompt saying someone turned the switch off.  As a result you have to retrace your steps and repeat the process all over again.  Other levels have you climbing staircases all the way up to the top floor of some factory, running to the other side of the room, then climbing staircases all the way back down again.  This mind-numbing backtracking is a persistent problem throughout the game.
Character movement is mostly annoying.  Yes, you can slow things down to the now famous bullet-time and hit special key combinations to perform cool moves, but here's the problem.  It takes a lot longer to perform these moves and you're subjected to so many faceless, nameless cops and security guards that it's quicker just to run up to them and mash buttons until you knock them out and move on.  Considering lost health restores automatically by standing still long enough, it's easier this way too.  Even more problematic, the game tries to think for you when you've got your guns drawn and you end up firing at stuff you're not even aiming at.  In one level, I was supposed to destroy three control panels.  I stood pointing directly at them at point blank range while my bullets were wildly firing in every direction other than straight ahead.
Bugs are prevalent.  You'll run into clipping problems (heads and arms appearing through walls) and unrealistic gameplay issues, like a door or elevator not working until you've killed every guard in the room.  In one level, I got to my objective (a telephone) before everyone was eliminated and found myself completely unable to continue the game or even move away from the telephone.  Best I could do was shut down and start over.  Sound issues are a problem for those with EAX and cutscenes are lower in volume than the sound effects.  You'll find yourself playing with the volume knob a lot.  At times, the game muted my sound card for no apparent reason at all.  A patch addresses some, but not all of these problems.
Most laughable are the so-called driving sequences.  Pretty much the only difference between playing as Niobe or Ghost, completing these levels is an exercise in frustration.  As Niobe the driver, the view is limited and the controls are sluggish.  As Ghost, riding shotgun with a shotgun, Niobe's driving is so bad you're safer keeping yourself inside the vehicle.  Strangest of all are the other cars on the road, violently gyrating left and right even at a complete standstill.  You'd think they were filled with horny teenagers.
After about an hour of this inane running, killing, running, killing, and following the little green arrow just to watch the next cinematic, it dawns on you that that's all there is to this game.  Out of sheer boredom, I entered a cheat so I could avoid the guards and get through the cinematics.  Even the current Hollywood fad of girl-on-girl liplocking (Monica Bellucci and Jada Pinkett Smith) couldn't keep me interested.
All this said, I still think the Wachowski Brothers had the right idea.  If the right developers (Id, Valve, EA, Monolith) were involved, this could have been impressive.  Unfortunately, Shiny Entertainment couldn't hack the Matrix, and neither should you.

For starters, comparing this game to Oblivion is a joke.  The framerate in Two Worlds is stuttery, the menu system is clunky, the collision detection (especially in combat) is inconsistent, the controls for horseriding is unresponsive (usually delayed by at least a second or two), and the difficulty is ridiculously inconsistent.  Within only a few hours of play I could easily slay a whole village of Groms (goblins), but after I walked up the wrong mountain I found a fist full of Cyclops in my face and BAM-instant death.

Anyone who seriously considers this game to be even a contender to Oblivion I suggest should have his/her head examined.

However, despite it's many, many, many flaws, the game can be quite enjoyable.  Even though the difficulty is unpredictable, the game is very forgiving since it allows you to ""respawn"" at the nearest healing statue without any penalty.  And, after you find a two-handed weapon, the collision detection is much less an issue than it is with a one-handed weapon.

But, definitely the most amusing and satisfying aspect of this game is the horrible dialogue and God-awful voice acting that will never get old to me.  The voice acting is an attempt at mimicing ""Olde English,"" but it is a miserable (and hilarious) failure, since it sounds like nothing more than ""American"" English with words like ""Perchance, Mayhap, Methinks, Tis"" and so on injected into the dialogue.

It sounds annoying, and I'm sure it is for most people, but I can't help but belly laugh at the overacting and absurd dialogue.  Take this quote for example, ""You've had a touch of the sunstroke, methinks.  Perhaps you should drink some water and lie down for a while.""

Another charm (which could also be called an annoyance, depending on your sense of humor) is your character's tendency to talk to himself in the most stupid ways imaginable.  After attempting to pick a lock and failing, my character showed his genius by saying out loud ""Hmmm, it's locked.""  Gee, ya think?  Another good one is when it starts to rain, several seconds later your character will wittingly say ""It's starting to rain.""  Brilliance!

If you didn't think any of that was funny, then don't bother with this title.  If you've never played Oblivion, now is a good time.  If you have and want another title of the same caliber, don't even try this game out.  Just play Oblivion again.

If you wish to try it anyway, I definitely suggest going in with a sense of humor and you may come out with some amusement.  Or maybe I should say it like this: ""When playing Two Worlds, perchance you will have some amusement methinks, if mayhap you have a sense of humor.""",I'd say give it a 4 if you have a sense of humor,1188604800,6,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",

Graphics is where SS shines: creative and clear details everywhere. Environmental design is not: after a short while the next corridor looks exactly like all the previous ones. And gives off the feeling of running in circles.

The game sounds are nothing to brag about either. The explosions and weapon discharges are well done, whereas the background music is good but nowhere near DS standards (I still use THAT theme as a ringtone).

There is no looting fun either. Dead enemies drop generic components which can be used to buy (equally generic) upgrades. No sets to complete, no unique items to find, no specially crafted weapons or armor to buy. As the game progresses cybernetic augmentations get available but as the in-game NTCs keep pointing out, there are added in expense to your character's humanity.

As to its length, it goes like the old Woody Allen joke on an elderly couple complaining about their rest home food: ""oye, it is awful!"", ""I know - and such small portions"".

Bottom line: if you expect a DUNGEON SIEGE in a futuristic setting you, well, that game is not out yet.

2.0,False,"07 6, 2007",A2HOWTC6MPKB7Q,B000FUONLM,T. A.,"I went out the first day MTW2 came out and bought it, installed it, and tried it out. I was a big fan of the first one which completely changed RTS's and was really enthusiastic about the sequel. I was a bit skeptical when I saw it was done by SEGA, which completely destroyed the fun in Rome: Total War when they unleashed their own version. Needless to say, MTW2 is no different.

Lets start off with my gaming rig. It is important to know what the reviewer is using to play the game, in my opinion.

SPECIFICATIONS

3.5 GHz AMD 64+ processors
Nvidia 8800 GTX
2048 MB
380 GB

That covers the basics needed to run the game. Now, I am using the most advanced and sophisticated graphics card on the face of the earth. However, MTW2 doesn't seem to care. I average 30 FPS with everything turned up to full, and I can't place over 3,000 troops in a battle, or I risk crashing. That is truly pathetic. Honest to God, why would you even buy something that's barely going to get a playable FPS rate? If you've seen the trailer, you need to ask yourself what the developers were using to create that. Mistake number 1.

The battles can be amazing, but your graphics card is probably going to melt if you want them to look nice. Mine almost did (no, I'm not kidding). However, the in-game AI is very unbalanced and seems to cheat at times. Your own units also have a habit of quitting an order you've assigned to them. The most unbalanced aspect of MTW2 is the auto-solve battles. If you don't want to fight one yourself, then click this little button. Be warned that outnumbering the enemy 5 to 1 probably isn't going to count, and you'll probably lose.

Sound is something that MTW2 doesn't fail to capture. It still has great music and voice-overs, but they get repetitive after a while.

The events system uses the worst drawings I have ever seen to describe what is going on. They look like BMP images done with MS Paint. Very outdated and lame. Couldn't you at least contact the people who made the paintings for Rome: Total War? Those were true beauties.

In game units are also something that are normally pathetic. Sherwood Forest archers... yeah, sure, they own if you're English and PWN all others, but they are FICTIONAL. WE WANT UNITS THAT ACTUALLY EXISTED. Remember the flaming pigs in RTW? Just about that bad...

The look of fights is still spectacular. Soldiers go one on one and use a large assortment of moves, including thrusts, slashes, stabs, shield smacks, and more.

Multiplayer is just terrible now, that is IF you can even access a session due to small amount of servers running. Be glad if you can find more than 15 total...

In conclusion, I'd say you should probably buy the predecessor of MTW2 or Rome: Total War. MTW2 needs a lot more work done. I feel it was released too early and should have been tweaked a bit more for bugs and repetitive issues.

I already know that this review is probably going to receive 0 ratings in trust and tons in ""this is false"". Well, it's going to be coming from the fanboys.

2.0,True,"05 25, 2008",A3W4NLU1LAA153,B000FPOJOS,Chris L,"Right up front, I'll point out the three most obvious things about GT5 Prologue.
1. It looks gorgeous
2. The AI is abominable.
3. There is still no car damage.

To use a lovely english expression : it's all mouth and no trousers. Look past the HD graphics and hype and you'll find Gran Turismo 1 lurking here.

The Gran Turismo games are known for their accurate car handling and fantastic graphics, and GT5 Prologue is no exception. The problem is that it is all absolutely ruined by the other driver AI. Previous Gran Turismo titles have never exactly shone when it comes to the AI, but in GT5 it's simply non-existent. It's not that the AI is dumb, it's just not there. The other cars all drive on rails, irrespective of where you are. For example, on the High Speed Ring circuit - there's a challenge to get from the back of the pack to the front in a single lap. In the car they give you, it is 100% impossible to come any higher than 3rd, and that's a stretch. The driving-on-rails is so accurate and predictable that you can actually predict exactly where every car will be at any given point. You'll come up behind the Ford Focus at the end of the second turn, and don't even think about passing him on the outside because he will always jink to the left for no reason as he goes across the bridge. If you're in the way, then tough. The game will just force you off the track. At the next corner, the Mazda 6 will always follow the identical line inside the corner, again irrespective of whether you're there.
The same is true in the other types of race. Within minutes of playing this game, you will find yourself making a tidy corner only to have a much faster car come right up behind you and ram you off the track because you're in the way of it's pre-programmed line. To see how truly awful it is, start a race at the back and watch the 15 cars in front of you. They'll all cut the same corner in the same way, every lap, all with the identical puff of dirt as they do it.
It is simply abominable.

The problem is that this issue was solved long ago by the likes of - well - just about every other racing franchise out there. It's compounded by the fact that there is still no car damage or dirt in GT5. You can stuff any car into a concrete armco at 175mph and it will simply bounce off without so much as a scratch. To think that Polyphony could put out a game with no car damage and ruinous AI on a next-gen console in 2008 just boggles the mind given how accomplished the competition is (think: Project Gotham Racing).

So what about the eye-candy aspect? Well - it runs at 1080p (full HD) and it looks absolutely spectacular. The textures are crisp and don't blur out at highly obtuse angles like they would on an X-Box. The car models are beautiful as are the various effects like the real-time reflections and the colour-flip paint jobs. There is some aliasing on high-contrast areas but detail popup is minimal. There are very noticable level-of-detail swaps on some of the cars where they swap from a low detail to a high detail version. It's most noticable on the Daytona circuit where you'll occasionally see the shading on the back of a car pop noticably as the model swaps to it's higher resolution version. In fact the eye-candy aspect is only marred slightly be the fact that the game clearly doesn't run at 60 frames per second. Well - it does on sparsely populated tracks but in the thick of the action on some circuits, you'll see noticable slowdown which you just shouldn't have on a console as powerful as a PS3.

What other things to know about? Well the online aspect of the game has a lot of promise but it's buggy at best. If your PS3 isn't set up pefectly on a broadband network (NAT type 1) it just won't connect to the servers. If you're lucky enough to have a good setup, then even when it does connect, the racing is a bit dodgy. It's obvious that the sample rate for your system communicating with all the others is fairly slow as you'll often see your opponents cars jump across the circuit from one side to the other, or suddenly appear to brake or accelerate at light speed as the servers catch up.

When you come to use the game for the first time, be prepared for a long wait. It seems to copy the entire blu-ray disc on to the internal hard drive which takes a good 15 minutes, then as soon as you connect, it will download a huge update which will take 5 to 10 minutes to download and another 5 minutes to install. So out-of-the-box to first race is about 30 minutes. That seems a bit odd to me - I was entirely expecting the game to run off the disc like many of the other PS3 titles.

So GT5 Prologue : it's great eye-candy, sure. But the two biggest, most long-standing problems with the GT franchise are still present. Awful AI and no car damage. The press previews and talk from Polyphony indicate that the full game will have car damage, but historically, they've never been known to change their underlying game engines between the 'Prologue' and the full versions of GT. They have always claimed that they've fixed the AI with each successive version of the game, but honestly - GT5 Prologue has taken a massive step backwards. They say it's better than ever but it's actually worse than ever. So when they say there will be car damage in the full game, I say 'cry wolf' I'm afraid.

It's an ominous omen for GT5 later this year. Sure it'll have more cars and more tracks. But chances are it will have the same problems the GT franchise has always had, and that's simply not good enough. Couple that with the questionable frame rate and online problems and that could be disastrous.

I dearly love the GT  franchise - I've had every one of them and I've been hoping and praying that they would one day fix the AI problems and the lack of car damage. If they've not done it on the PS3, then it's just never going to happen, and that is a sad indictment of Polyphony's marketing strategy. I've played this game a lot, desperately wanting to like it but I always put the controller down and am left with an empty feeling. It's just not exciting.",Different console.

-Had to set the game on easy just to make it out of the starting gate
-This is not an open world game
-You can not freely explore your areas of travel, instead you have to back track, so there is no roaming where you want to go.
no climbing or hopping over obstacles like you could do in the newest Tomb Raider game..
-As far as I can tell there is also no rolling in the game. (Maybe I haven't figured it out yet) So in battle..
-Heavy emphasis on switching combat styles in mid battle (at least this seems to be the case)
-Clunky Combat/combat system

Now for the more positive things
+Atmospheric game ) doesn't rank "" 2014 tomb raider quality"" but.. its here
+Crafting system is pretty cool. More nitty gritty than I expected.
+You can craft on the fly! Which considering the lack of freedom you have everywhere else.. this really
kinda surprises me.
+Traps work well, does a lot of damage
+Magic works well (When you use fireballs the enemies feel the heat)
+Projectile weapon seems to work really well (Crossbow)

The main thing for me, when I deal with any game, is exploration and how well my character interacts with the environment and THE FREEDOM of acts my character has.. with the environment and enemies..etc.  This game is really lacking on some key fronts for a adventure rpg that has come out in 2014. Seriously I hate pressing a button to engage in an action (press 'A' to climb on this ledge). That's 1980's... garbage.

Hey Huff here, listen up! I personally am not a huge fan of COD fanchise, however, i do enjoy their multiplayer Bot-Battle mod. You know that mode that you play when you personally don't have the time or patients to go online but just wanna go on a random killing spree by setting up a multiplayer game with bots as your opponents when you are alone or with actual friends (not online).
I purchased a PC-version of this game in order enjoy a little Bot slaying whenever i am not able to play on the Xbox360. However, to my suprise it would seem the dev team decided that the PC version *will only function if you are connected online*... WTH! Instead they replace this mode concept with sum terrible and boring ""tower defense"" like s***. A huge let down for me.
Unless you are playing Campiegn nothing else can be done solo-dolo *without online connectivity*... not even Zombies. So for those of you that were hoping to for more freedoms alone... this is not the one.

HOWEVER

the product itself is so bad, i instead decided to re write the review to better reflect this product.

THIS IS NOT A GAMING KEYBOARD.

despite the advertising, this is not a gaming keyboard.  there isn't even any media keys to mute sound let alone a windows disabling key which is rather standard for this type of product. and no, just because it has a few rubberized keys doesnt make it a gaming keyboard.  this is a plain jane keyboard, no bells or whistles.  but you can expect that for 20 bucks right?

sure.

in fact, the only positive about this keyboard is that it does have the rubberized keys.  unlike the previous reviewer, i did receive the proper keys, no duplicates.  but this positive is also a negative as i did not receive the tool needed to remove the keys so i instead had to use a letter opener to pop off the keys, no big deal but still kind of a bummer.  then, the rubberized keys sit higher than the other keys so the rubberized nature of the keys causes your finger to get caught on them and actually hinders your typing ability.

also, the backspace key is so small, im constantly hitting the ""\"" key instead, its soemthing i will have to merely adjust to, but its a nuisance.

also, the peg that attaches to the keyboard on the wrist rest included with the keyboard broke off just after putting it on!!  lol, im not even kidding!  i would post pictures but honestly this product wasn't worth the time to write this review let alone post up pics of all the things wrong with it!

The actual volleyball part of the game is When I hear the title ""XTREME"" Volleyball, I want solid gameplay, but you get none of that. And what makes it extreme anyway? Sure the bodacious babes are a big plus, but the gameplay relies on just hittin the ball over the net with 2 buttons and hoping you get points. I just felt the lack of interaction. Heck, Tecmo didnt' even bother to apply the scoring rules to this volleyball game.  Only A and B buttons are used.  There are basically only 2 things you can do on offense, hit the ball up in the air for your partner, then spike it over the net. Fun? Um, not hardly. The computer basically decides the matches and who wins. There is no strategy involved, it's just game for looks and busty babes, nothing more. This is Tecmo, the makers of Ninja Gaiden and DOA Hardcore? Anyway, then after a boring day playing volleyball, you have to go back to the lame Island mode and waste time going through useless and boring places on the island. You try to earn the love of other girls by buying them swimsuits and gifts. Why would one find this enticing?  I'm sorry, this game sucks. Sounds like a harsh description, but if it wasn't the redeeming factor of the sweet graphics, this game would be a total disappointment.  Is it the worst volleyball game ever? No. But when you pit it against the quality of Sega's game on the Cube, it's just further proof how bad the volleyball engine really is.

The graphics are amazing though. The ladies look better than ever and if they were real I'd defintely want a few dates. It's actually the same engine Tecmo used in Dead Or Alive 3 for the XBOX. You'll recognize one of the beaches being taken directly from the 3, and it looks amazing. Seagulls flying in the background, warm sand curdling your girls feet, and the ocean hitting the sand over the horizon. There are also new beaches, jungles and islands to play volleyball. Once again, lush scenery, fantastic animations and great graphics are nice, but when the gameplay sucks, who cares? For the guys that bought the game strictly for the babes, they might appreciate the ""Gravure System"" as Tecmo calls it. On days when you want to be alone with your girl, you can take her somewhere alone on the island and just look at her basking in the morning sun. You're thoughts of being there with her might be fun for awhile and mind you it is ultra realistic. You can zoom in on her, change the camera view and take her to different locations. For added visuals, you can also give your girl a nice tan and hook her up with countless bikinis. You can buy tanning oil in the accessory shop and you can watch them over time get a lush golden tan from the sun. If you want to keep them healthy, you can also buy sun block. Sigh. This sucks.

2.0,False,"06 28, 2004",AQMWZIH22R6LE,B0000TSR4C,TwistaG,"Like Enter the Matrix last year, Driv3r is buggy and clearly unfinished. The mess isn't as extensive as it was with Neo's nightmare -- Tanner's latest adventures as an undercover cop aren't quite that treacherously crash-prone -- but poorly tuned gameplay and controls sink what should have been a rousing ride from one of Grand Theft Auto's primary forefathers. Bugs and technical issues first. We tested three boxed copies of Driv3r on three different consoles, and a clear pattern of glitches emerged. The most common issue: The game often freezes for between three and ten seconds, then usually resumes without harm. Sometimes, however, it locks up permanently, requiring a reboot. Also, collision-detection mishaps are widespread -- everything from Tanner to his vehicle sometimes passes through walls or gets stuck in walls in a way that significantly interferes with gameplay. Frame-rate sluggishness and pop-up issues are also prevalent. Surprisingly, the pop-up doesn't involve the environment -- in fact, your line of sight is impressively long -- but cars and other traffic often teleport into existence a short distance down the road, adding unfairly to the challenge of high-speed driving. As far as the actual gameplay, Driv3r is like a car badly in need of a tune-up. Like the first two games, you play as an undercover cop infiltrating car-theft gangs by posing as a driver. Reflections created three sprawling cities and added new elements like speedboats and shooter-style gameplay on foot, but at its core, the game still revolves around high-speed pursuits. The best part of the action is how the cars handle on the bleeding edge of losing control. As in past Reflections games (Stuntman and other entries in the Driver series), making the smallest mistake can be lethal, particularly because excessively bouncy physics and insanely invulnerable obstacles (like lamp posts!) can send your vehicle cartwheeling into absurd wipeouts. Completing missions becomes a test of your stubbornness and endurance, and most players won't be able to stomach the process of incessantly repeating a mission until they succeed. The new on-foot gameplay also just flat-out sucks, and it figures far too heavily into the action. Aiming your weapon is an aggravating chore, the enemy A.I. is horribly lame, and there's just not a scrap of fun to be had. Visually, Driv3r looks outdated. Unsurprisingly, the Xbox version is substantially prettier, featuring richer lighting and smoother details that outshine the more pixelated PS2 game. The game's star power (voice acting by Michael Madsen, Ving Rhames, and more) and an impressive soundtrack make for a surprisingly good showing on the audio side. All these glitches and design problems don't make Driv3r unplayable, and the problems aren't as deep or as devastating as they were in Enter the Matrix, another much-hyped Atari disappointment. But they do make the game an intensely frustrating trial of patience that's rewarded with only the most fleeting glimmers of fun. If you love the Driver series with an unswerving loyalty, you'll be able to slog through Driv3r and extract your thrills. But if you're looking for something to tide you over until GTA: San Andreas is released later this fall, you'd better execute a 180 spin, floor it, and flee in the opposite direction.",They need to go back to the drawing board,1088380800,2,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},

But, I have to admit like the others have said, the game takes a long time to load. First, you have to load to get to the menu. That takes a while. Then, you have to load career. That takes longer. Then, you you have to load the tournament....which also takes a long time. Aah, finally...that is what you wanted to hear me say, isn't it? No....it is still not over yet. You now have to load the match!

I have a very fast PC with a damn good graphics accelerator. Still, it takes such a long time to load.

There are graphic glitches as well. Sometimes, everything goes in slow motion or the screen freezes. It happens occasionally. And from what I know about tennis, ball boys are supposed to pick up the ball when it hits the net, which they don't. They just run leaving the ball where it is. It looks silly when they do that. One other reviewer mentioned that having the Number 1 and Number 2 player in the same draw is an inexcusable error. Boy, was that an understatement? I guess he was being nice. Almost all the top players are put in one draw and the rest are put in the other. This is a mockery of tennis.

Other major goof ups: The whole attitude stuff after each point is silly and extremely irritating to say the least. Watch some professional tennis matches and tell me which player does those stupid attitude things. This is not a popularity contest. This is tennis. No player I remember ever does the things they show in this game, unless they are big time jerks.

There are no replays, which is not realistic. And as far as I can remember, I have never seen anyone playing tennis with pants in grand slam events. It looks pathetic. This is the 21st century. Not early 1900s. The entire rival player idea is pathetic. The player's rival loses in the first round of every tournament, yet keeps rising up in the rankings rapidly. That is plainly impossible. And the stupid e-mails the rivals send make these players look like a bunch of 12-year-olds getting at each other. There was no need for a rival scenario in the game. It just makes the game look ridiculously stupid. And in the real world, a player's major rival is almost always from a different country. Federer-Nadal, Edberg-Becker, Graf-Seles...so on. Sampras-Agassi was one major exception.

But, the bottom line, is it fun to play? It is if you can ignore the comments from your rival. Less than $10 for this game is a reasonable price, which is what is charged here. But, the errors should make you think twice about buying this game for a higher price. Tennis is definitely better, however, on many levels. Tennis Masters Series by Microids could have easily beaten this game as being the best out there. But what was lacking there were a lot options available in Top Spin.

I have no idea how Top Spin 3 fares in comparison. But, I can tell you that the makers of that game decided to isolate the PC gamers. But, I cannot blame 2K for that entirely. This trend has been going on for a while. EA, 2K, and several gaming organizations are slowly doing away with the manufacture of PC games. That means the gaming users need to adapt and get the consoles.

2.0,False,"03 5, 2011",A2WKM9BXOC4JH9,B003ZJ5B4I,Functional,"I have to say I am not impressed with this keyboard, considering its price point; the main reason is the layout of the keys. The keyboard I had before this one is a Saitek Eclipse - which was great and after using the Black Widow I can see just how good it really was...so let's find out why.

Five Macro Buttons

The macro buttons on the side are annoying because they're so close to the main keys, it's easy to push one of them instead of CTRL or TAB. The macro keys should have been recessed - that is, flush with the surface of the keyboard. Instead they are the same height and shape as the rest of the keys on the board.

CAPS LOCK WTF!?

The worst part of the Blackwidow is the design of the CAPS LOCK key. For some reason unknown to me, Razer decided to put a CAPS LOCK key on this board that is NOT indented. Most good keyboards, including Razer's cheaper boards, have an indentation on the caps lock key, which creates an extra gap between the A key and caps lock. Why? Because when you are typing fast and/or gaming, you will be hitting the caps lock key inadvertently very often. It's such a small thing, but it really ruins the board's precision in both typing and gaming.

Ghosting - Yes, it's there...

Want to test the quality of your keyboard's circuity? Check for ghosting. Ghosting is simply referring to how many keys you can depress simultaneously. I found the Black Widow to be average in this respect, yet Razer specifically mentions on the box ""anti ghosting matrix"" as if to imply the Black Widow is somehow better than average.

The test? Try it yourself. Hold down both shift keys and push each letter key in a row. This is what I get:

QWERTY
AFGHJKL
ZXCVB

Notice that both S and D fail to work, which is a big problem for a gaming keyboard, considering that WASD are the primary keys for movement in just about any game where you move. What I'm saying is that if Razer is going to claim that it has ""anti-ghosting"" features built into the keyboard then WASD should be the keys that DO NOT ghost, even if other keys do.

For comparison, here is the same ghosting test performed on my Saitek Eclipse:

QWERUIOP
ASDFGHJKL
BN

As you would expect, the WASD keys DO NOT ghost on the Saitek as they do on the Razer.

Comfort

There is no wrist rest included with the Black Widow. I find that odd considering it's intended use is ""extended gaming"", which for some nerds could mean 24+ hours locked in their mom's basement. Without a wrist rest your hands will begin to feel fatigue within 30 mins to an hour of playing (or typing). Most keyboards that cost $20 or more have some kind of ergonomic considerations in their designs. This board does not.

Noise

A lot of people seem to like the tactile clicking you get with a mechanical keyboard...in my opinion it does not improve precision and the noise level is substantially more than a good membrane keyboard. It's not as bad as those old IBM keyboards but it's pretty close.

So what is good about this board?

You've read all these raving reviews saying how great this board is, yet here I am telling you that it sucks. Well I can say that the quality of the back-lighting is very good. Each key seems to have its own LED so the illumination is very crisp...but that aside, there isn't really any justification for spending $80 or $100+ on this board. If you are a serious gamer, I would SERIOUSLY consider purchasing a keyboard from Saitek or Logitech - without a lot of extra buttons or ""macro"" features. Along with the keyboard, get a gamepad like the N52TE or G13.

One thing to keep in mind when you read these positive amazon reviews. A lot of them can be fake, posted by Razer to artificially inflate the rating. Another thing is that people who compare the Black Widow to some cheap $5 generic board are going to feel that the Black Widow is a lot better.

2.0,False,"10 23, 2006",A20TZ1MQ0KMJRR,B000GJX6ZG,Jaha,"First off I would love to ask the developers why this game was delayed a month!?  I have been loyal to 2K since their first hockey offering and I waited patiently until this year.  I went out and bought NHL 07, was promptly disappointed, sold that game and waited for this.  What a waste.

NHL 2K7 is virtually unchanged since last year barring some minor menus alterations and updated rosters.  I cannot find anything that could make a month delay understandable.  This game could have easily come out in June.  Whats worse about the delay is that the game appears to be unfinished or at least poorly tested.

The gameplay of 2K7 is almost identical to 2K6 and it is the best part of the game.  Although on higher levels the game deteriorates into a hitting bonanza and what is up with penalties!?!?  One of the great things about 2K hockey was the slide bars to slowly adjust the game in all aspects but for some reason I could not get the penalties right.  Either I would get 20 penalties a game on one setting or none at all on slightly lower scales.  I still am struggling to get the bars even so you get nice parity.

Fighting still stinks.  It's a joke really and shouldn't even be here if that is all they can do with it.  Hockey players don't turn around in the middle of a fight.  EA's fighting system was much more interesting.

The on the fly coaching is great.  I loved this feature and it is still here which is a plus.  However the other strategy features aren't always responsive.  For instance the pressure meters or the face off setups don't always resond to your input.  just a frustrating thing.

The biggest gripe I have with this game is just the simple menu navigation.  Is it entirely neccessary to have 8,000 menu's to navigate but when you traverse them all you still can't find what you want.  The text and color schemes wear on the eyes and become hard to read after a while.  Menus take a while getting used to as well.

Plus in Franchise mode I have noticed some major annoying features.  One, changing your teams playing strategy requires you to adjust it during each game.  I am sure there is a save function somewhere in all those menus but I haven't found it.  In the Franchise screnes there is no way to save your strategy setups and I find myself having to do it before each game.  Also everytime a player is hurt or removed from your roster the computer resets your lines to the asinine defaults.  I have the Auto-fill and auto-coach features off but the game is programmed to mandate that all lines must be full so if a player is removed it will reset.  What an annoyance when you completely change all of your lines from 5on5 to PP and PK lines, etc then have them all reset and have to set them over again.  A simple save lines function would be very easy and super nice.

Some other glaring omissions.  No salary cap?  EA had the cap in play and it was nice to keep up with the NHL but here there is only the budget which can easily be manipulated.  The deke's have pretty much been removed from the game making gameplay a little more bland, and lastly the feature of allowing teams to offer bonus incentives to players in their contract is useless.  Incentives never seem to have any impact on whether a player will sign with you or not.

The franchise mode in 2K7 is fairly neat with it's minor league team however much of all the bells and whistles are quickly identified as cotton candy features.  What does this mean?  Well for the most part most of the franchise feautres have no bearing on anything other than distracting you into thinking you are managing your team.  But the reality is your coaching staff, contract offers, minor league team, etc really don't do anything.  You can take the worst coaches, never have your players practice, ignore the chemistry meters, etc and the game isn't really any different.  Also the game rarely rewards you with much when you do participate in these things.  EA's franchise mode is far more in depth and complete compared to this.

Sadly though even though I don't care for this game gameplay wise it still is better than EA's.  NHL 07 had the worst gameplay I have ever seen in a hockey game so I am stuck with 2K7 this year.

Next year I hope these developers actually put some meat in this shell of a decent hockey game.  Sadly seeing as how this game hasn't changed at all for the past 4 years I doubt it.",2K is losing me as a customer!,1161561600,9,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},

Twenty-nine hours later, I'm left wondering: Why?

The main plot, even with the major fork near the end, is pitifully short, and it can be completed in twenty-odd hours.  No matter how much time you put into levelling up your party members, their skill sets will never get better.  You aren't allowed to upgrade your party members' equipment.  Other than having other people to act as targets, there really isn't much use for the people you recruit.  When the game is touted as having an involving storyline with an emphasis on recruiting friends to help, I just can't help but think that the experience is incredibly lacking.

Certainly, the graphics are pleasant (they have a very nice, almost watercolor look to them), and the music is decent, but that's not really enough to hang a game on.

 The map feature is inexplicably obtuse  by focusing only on local areas ,it prevents any kind of 'big picture' view which is frustrating .Another is the sheer volume of mouse clicking needed for battle. I have to take repeated breaks from battle just to rest my wrist. This is the only game ive ever encountered where this is necessary.
 Fighting airborne foes causes crazy whiring camera angles that makes tracking an enemy very difficult.
 Overall  Its a colorful game but with  awkward looking characters and the voice acting is stilted but that doesnt bother me as I simply turned it off outright and just read the dialouge.
 The graphical appearance reminds me of Quake 2 . There are a lot of key bindings to keep in mind with at least one that never seemed to have been installed. The ability to heal NPCs that are under your care seems to have never been implemented or if it has I cant figure out how to do it. I discovered you CAN heal NPCs but only with a healing spell and NOT with items
I like to keep my game play simple and though ive been largely able to play using this method its still a bit obtuse and awkward .I frequently have to pause the game to consult the key bindings. Your character develops an appearance using a variety of ...moral...I guess choices which is neat and You can alter your appearance by purchasing tattoos and hairstyles that impact your goodness or evilness rating but not as much more than behavior.
 Overall this game is fun but not without issues. Skyrim is an example of how to do these types of games right as it has an elegant and smooth interface whereas Fables is clumsier and just too 'busy'.
 Another odd thing about this game is its weird way of measuring time. According to my stats Ive been playing for less than 30 game days but ive aged to my late 30s from my mid teens , so im aging an an accelerated rate but I physically don't show it nor has my performance deteriorated in any observable way ,moreover  I don't even know if Ill die of old age before completing the story.
 This game is pretty low on charm and I set it aside at the plot point where im in a torture chamber being made to run a race. Maybe ill pick it up again later....maybe not.

These are the criteria I rated these X42 headphones on:

1) Sound quality:  I don't hear the buzzing or hum that other reviewers hear on this headset.  The sounds are pretty clear, although bass is weak even when using its 'bass boost' feature; low-frequency sound effects just cannot be reproduced well in a headset.  Even though they sell this as a 'surround sound' headset, like the others above I reviewed, you cannot hear much difference between 'front' and 'rear' sounds, regardless of the 6 surround variations you can choose.  Headphones cannot give you the spaciousness of true surround like external speakers can.

2) Microphone:  The mic is on a flexible boom, unlike any of the others, which was nice to be able to position it better.  Also, one thing I liked about this mic is that you can hear your own voice through it.  The others I tested above do not do this, which I think is helpful when the game sounds are loud.  The mic does not auto-mute, like some others with straight boom mics.

3) Comfort:  The ear cups on the X42 are a harder foam than the others above.  The cups rest completely around the ears and no parts rest on the ear itself.  This causes some pressure on your head around the ear that can get uncomfortable.  Also, there is more space this way between the drivers and your ear, which causes a loss of bass response, but decent midrange and highs.  The headband padding is somewhat hard as well, which can also cause discomfort in prolonged use.

4) Features:  The X42 is loaded with features, but are they useable/useful?  There are 4 equalizer settings on the headset itself:  flat, bass boost, treble boost, bass and treble boost.  Bass boost really doesn't do much for low sounds in the 50-200Hz range, but it does boost the higher bass a bit.  I didn't feel like it needed any treble boosting since it sounded treble-heavy to begin with, so I left the setting on bass boost.  The transmitter also has a surround-sound on/off and 6 variations of virtual speaker placement.  I did not find any discernible difference in sound for any of the 6 settings.

A couple things about wireless vs. wired headsets:  One problem I had with this X42 is that the wireless connection is just a few milliseconds delayed from the signal.  So when you have your home theater or external speakers on with the headset on, you can hear the delay as an echo, which can get annoying.  This does not happen with wired headsets.  On the plus side though, the wireless headphones can be used with any device that has an optical or stereo output, like a home stereo, TV, laptop, cell phone, etc.  The transmitter receives the digital optical signal or an analog stereo signal and broadcasts to the headset.  Of course, you cannot use the mic unless you can plug it into something like the XBox controller or your laptop mic port.

Concluding, I think this headset is OK if it were priced lower.  But the Sennheisers are more comfortable because they rest right on the ear, and the SteelSeries are comfortable and have better bass response (but mine suffer from an annoying hum from the chat circuit).  Plantronics are substandard and I don't recommend them.  Turtle Beach X42, at this price point, is not worth the cost in my opinion.",Look for something cheaper and wired,1338508800,,{'Edition:': ' Surround Sound'},

- Want to play any mode beside one-on-one online?  Too bad. Doesn't work.
- You've started a career with a new CAW and you want to use that CAW online. Too bad, doesn't work.  You have to specifically create your star in the creations section, THEN start the career with that created star. If you create him through career mode, you can't use him for anything else.
- I wish I knew that sooner, because now I want to use him. No biggie, just delete the career save file and restart with a created character (even though I lose several hours of gameplay).  Oh wait- the game saves EVERYTHING on ONE file. So if you want to delete your career mode, you lose everything you've done and unlocked in the entire game.

The story line was not engaging and did not keep my wanting to play. The gameplay itself was boring. I am not a huge stealth fan, but the execution in this game was poor. When you get spotted, you will almost always die since you cannot fight to save your life (I know that is the point, but still) and you cannot really outrun anyone. So no fight or flight in this game.

The graphics were sub par for a major PS4 title. I would say they are a step below Half Life 2... yes... that outdated at this point. I am fine with graphics not being groundbreaking, but the gameplay needs to make up for that. Some of the better games currently on the PS4 are the cheap/free PSN games, but their gameplay is fun and engaging; however, this game is not.

-The game is fun for the most part when it's working right, and if you can stand the boring cut scenes that you can't skip.
-Unlocking things is relatively fun.
-There's a lot of replay value to missions, redoing them under different criteria, and an online mode.
-Actual FPS, with okay touch controls.

Bad
-The in game movie sequences are unskipable, not as cool as the developers probably thought, and even if they were they probably wear down on the second and third viewing since they're built into the missions and unskipable.
-This game is HORRIBLY glitchy. I'm shocked none of the reviews touch on it, but Google around. To name some glitches I've personally had.
The game froze. Each time you get something such as a headshot, it displays that you gained an accolade. It has to display each one individually. I amassed something like a multi kill (must display each individually and a multikill), rank up, headshots, bronze weapon usage, stealth kill all at once. It was too much and it froze the game. Sometimes you can see the game stuttering to get multiple awards out.
I was doing a stealth run and my Ally AI decided to go Rambo on all the unsuspecting enemies. As usual autosave messed everything up so the mission had to be restarted from scratch. Very frustrating.
I fell through the floor at one point and through several floors of the level, dying. Very frustrating.

Glitches seem to primarily happen when you replay missions, only once did I have something happen in the main story.
The game decided to stop spawning enemies at the end of a (in my personal opinion) long mission. I could not complete the mission and autosave ensured suiciding did not work. By the way killing yourself eats into your funds.

-Also annoying is that the multiplayer seems to have connection issues and a low player count. The two combined make for a bad experience. The skill level of the people I played against was very low in spite of them being much higher than me. They just seemed to constantly trigger vanguards (think COD Care package) and then let me steal them and go around killing them. I'd almost think they were bots they are just so terrible.
-The weapons are not as cool as you'd think. Somehow the shotgun that lights people on fire just isn't awe inspiring.
-Because the game uses the typical system where you are ""Rewarded for everything you do"", it has the flaws of the other games that do this (such as Bulletstorm). Shooting barrels to blow people up is really fun and cool for example, but doesn't reward you near as much as a simple headshot, to give one example.

I still recall fondly the first version that came out on the original Playstation.  It was such a technical and entertaining breakthrough back then.

The present version for Gamecube is, unfortunately, quite a significant letdown.  Maybe it's because I played it after playing Burnout 3 for the Xbox, an outstanding arcade racer that packs tons of action with impressive graphics.  Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2, on the other hand, feels very lame.  The framerate is the most serious problem: even on an empty open road, the graphics can become jerky.  When you have cops on your tail and a couple other cars on the road, the framerate can drop so low that the game is almost unplayable for a second or two.  This just gives a frustrating experience.

The graphics is also lacking, compared to Gran Turismo and Burnout and other outstanding racing games.  I don't think it's a problem with Gamecube's processing power; other racing games have better graphics on the GC than Need for Speed.  It's apparently because EA uses the Need for Speed series as a cash cow, to hook long-time fans such as yours truly, and they just don't invest much in improving the game's look and feel.  Three or four years ago this game's graphics would have been acceptable, but not in today's crowded racing game marketplace.

Car physics is also annoying for an arcade game like this.  Burnout 3 has the perfect arcade, non-realistic physics which makes controlling your cars and racing so much fun and enjoyable.  Need for Speed, on the other hand, turns into a rather frustrating experience.

This is unacceptable.  8MB equates to around 500 blocks of space for the XBOX.  500 blocks would only hold one Splinter Cell save, there are some games (KOTOR) that you can't even save because the file is too big.  Sure the XBOX has a massive hard drive, but what about those of us who want to back up our hours of game play in case the XBOX has problems and require service?  You hard drive will more than likely lose all of your data after it returns from service.  What if your hard drive just quits on you one day?

If you want to back up your XBOX data in case a catastrophe occurs, you have two options 1).  Purchase anywhere from 50 - 100 of these little Memory Units at $22 a pop 2).  Purchase a bigger memory card, like MegaXKey, or Max Drive for XBOX, that hold 4 times the space for only $10 more.  On top of both of these cards also allow you to moves your XBOX saves to your PC's hard drive and even burn them to a CD.  Because of the included USB to XBOX adapter you can connect these to both your PC and XBOX; this means you can back up all of your savable game files to your PC by only having to buy one memory card.  Better yet, use of these items do not require your XBOX to be modded in anyway. After backing up all of my data to my PC, I restored them to my XBOX and had no problems with the files although the Max Drive is a little more user friendly and also can go up to 64MB!

XBOX's are composed of man-made mechanical items that will eventually fail or have problems.  No one wants to lose all of their data just because they are unable to back up their stuff.  It is too bad Microsoft forces their customer to depend on the hard drive only since they do not offer a cost-effective, efficient method of back up.  To add insult to injury, they don't even offer bigger memory cards!  8MB is the largest and ONLY memory card option they have!

I love my XBOX, but Microsoft really needs to get with the program here and offer bigger memory cards and also an option to back up saved game files.  If other companies can do it, why can't they?  Unless you want to carry around a pocketful of these tiny memory cards, your best option for back up is something like MegaXKey or MaxDrive.

  So I purchased a 2 gig video ram card Nvidia... I forget. However I can now play the game!... Very slowly at it's lowest settings which really made me wish I invested a bit more in the graphics card I bought. The one I purchased works great on most games though! I guess this one is just more hightech? I really wish I splurged at least 20 dollars or more on the card I bought and may have been able to play this game. But it's sadly gonna have to sit with the couple other games that are still unplayable with my new card. What's upsetting is I just recently purchased the new graphics card in hopes of playing this game. I don't know why, after doing research I found out the marketing team payed a lot of game reviewers to give it a great score, the sequel is coming out soon too. So if you can't run this, I'm certain you can't run the sequel. (Sometimes it's not allways the place. Anyway, now that it kind of works I upped the rating a star. Otherwise, try to get this on console so you don't have to bother trying to get it working. Or if you have a fancy computer with a great graphics card, then it might be fun?

I have played games requiring DirectX 11 before on my system, but apparently my graphics card is just one step behind what's needed to play this game. Especially since it was released on the Xbox 360 and PS3 I assumed it would run on my PC since those systems aren't compatible with DX11. So, I recommend triple checking your machine before purchasing and if it looks like you just have the minimum requirements, don't attempt to buy it! It probably won't work, and I've tried all sorts of tweaks and mods to get it working. I'll keep working on it, but for now I have better games to play, which is unfortunate. I don't know why they would require DX11 on the pc version then make the console versions using dx10 or 9. (Which would have worked great on my system) All and all I was pretty excited at finding the price and it was the last of my money. You can't return any steam downloads once activated.  :(  This was supposed to be how I spent my weekend too.
  Ultimately I'm pretty surprised the developers haven't made a patch or mode to make the game work with DX10! I'll be looking forward to trying this game in a few years when I can afford a system to run it. :( I just finally got a gaming desktop PC and can finally play all those games that came out over the past 10 years that I always wanted to try. I just hope something good happens where I can afford a decent computer system. I'm pretty sad about this.

At the same time, I was also a little weary. I used to LOVE the talent behind Obsidian. This, after all, is a studio formed by many of the top talent that formerly worked at Interplay and the much-venerated Black Isle Studios. Between 9 and 12 years ago, I went through some of the best gaming experiences thanks to the original Fallout games, Planescape: Torment and Icewind Dale. Despite this rich history, starting with Star Wars: KOTOR II Obsidian's products have become progressively worse. KOTOR II had a great story but was mired by several bugs and, well...depending on how you made certain choices, large chunks of the story towards the endgame unfolded without a shred of logic. Then they delivered Neverwinter Nights 2, which again had everything going for it, except for some horrendous bugs. At least one bug was game-breaking.

It is the same story with Alpha Protocol. While the plot is serviceable, and the dialogue system is fairly engaging, the rest of the game leaves much to be desired. Graphics, character models and animations are clunky and laughable. From the very first trailer, the game looked long in the teeth. What is shocking is the fact that they used the Unreal 3.0 engine and still botched it up. No its not the best engine out there (*kaff* Crytek *kaff*), but its capable of building some pretty nifty looking worlds.

The sound is very average. Personally I've heard worse voice acting, especially in some of the European imports. The music fits the mood (some plain Bond/Bourne rip-offs) but doesn't have much character.

Gameplay is mostly bad, but there are a few bright spots. The gunplay is wonky - and is particularly frustrating if you, like myself, spent a couple of months earlier this year with Commander Shepard and Co. Mini-games like hacking get old fast, but that's a complaint I have about mini-games in a lot of RPGs. Surprisingly I like the time-limit in the dialogue choices. It really makes you feel like you are a spy under pressure and its quite a thrill to decide someone's fate in the space of 5 seconds. I also like the weapons/skill customization - which is fleshed out properly enough.

A glaring hole is the (non-existent) artificial intelligence. My favorite bug is when baddies keep on climbing up and down the same ladder for no reason whatsoever.

As far as plot goes...its okay. But then again story has never been Obsidian's weakness. I can see two reasons why Alpha Protocol turned out the way it did. One: Obsidian just wanted to shove this out the door when they inked the deal to develop Fallout New Vegas. And two: They just don't have a good game development process in place. Which is a pity, given the good writers on staff.

I hope Obsidian is taking note as I am certainly not the only individual feeling this way. After this mess, I doubt I'll blindly go out and buy Fallout New Vegas - original developers or no (I am so bloody scared about how it turns out!) From now on, Obsidian is going to have to work hard to get my hard-earned money.

My advice to prospective buyers: wait till the game hits the sub $30 mark - give it 6 to 12 months. Actually you are better of re-visiting an old RPG like The Witcher or something.

It's basically BioShock in space, from the over-used art-deco visual motifs down to the way ""neuromods"" are injected into your body (skills/abilities).

The game map itself is very small, taking place entirely on a space station, which has about 12 sections. To get from one section to the next, you have to suffer a 1-2 minute load time. If you play this game from start to finish, you will literally waste several hours of your life on load screens. This is absolutely the worst aspect of the game, and possibly a limitation of the CryEngine. It really takes you out of the experience, and I dreaded having to go through a door. Compare this to Zero Dawn Horizon, which is free roam and open world, with no load times.

Most rooms and computer terminals are initially locked and you have to find the corresponding keycard or password in another part of the station to progress. So typical gameplay is, go to one section of the station, find the card/code then go back to the other part of the station. You will have to travel back and forth between sections many times. Some locks require hacking to open, which you can do once you've acquired the right hacking skill level. Hacking an item opens a timed maze mini-game. Get the cursor into the target and avoid the walls of the maze, which shock and slow you down. Some doors absolutely require the appropriate card to open and are not hackable.

The weapons are very limited, underpowered, and lame: shotgun, Gloo gun (shoots incapacitating foam), stun gun, pistol, wrench, etc. The game is set in 2032 which is not that far in the future, but really, some better, more original weapons would've been more fun. I ended up using the wrench most of the game because most of the weapons were useless. The pistol, for example, does a paltry 12 damage! 12!

Enemy design is also very limited. You'll see only about a dozen different kinds of aliens, which either float, scuttle, or are bipedal. There's not much variation. One aspect of the game I did enjoy was the materials recycler, but maybe that's because of my OCD. Put unwanted items in the bin and convert them to basic materials cubes, which can be fed into a Fabricator to make items/weapons/upgrades.

I finished the game, out of nothing more than pure stubbornness. I wish I hadn't. The ending is extremely unsatisfying. I won't spoil it for you, but it's really disappointing and made me feel even worse about wasting many hours on the game. It's a bit disingenuous to have spent so much time playing to find out that the ending is what it is, and that your actions have no consequence. If you rescue crew, there's no reward at the end. You are also lied to. One of the objectives in a side mission is to ""escape Talos I"". If you complete the step, the game immediately ends with a voiceover!

2) Graphics are ok, but I am also a person that would rather have gameplay over graphics, so they didn't bother me. I still thought they were good.

3) Way, way, way too many audio glitches on my end.

4) Sure, dialog is great, but there needs to be a limit. As a preface, I am a neurotic completionist, hence my achievement complaint, so I am not your average lets just get this over with thumb twitcher looking for my next adrenaline fix as another reviewer wrote. Here is where I will pre-defend myself against the RPG freaks. It seems like too many ""hardcore"" RPG'rs get off on saying I spend X number of hours playing this game. Another is, sure it may not be great, but think about dollars per game time, and it is worth it. I do not count tons of 10 min conversations as game time. Also, I do love character delevolpment and background story, but this game takes it way too far. Also, when you push a button to get to the next sentence, sometimes it takes you to the next sentence, and sometimes the entire story ends. See point 8) for more on the dialog complaint.

5) Tactics. The tactics are fine for people that don't want to micro-manage and a good idea, BUT I all too often found the basic AI running the characters to be way too flawed. Too often, my guys would just run off the screen into big fights, so throttle them back right. Then they will just stand there and let people hit them. Seriously, no matter what the setting, if one guy comes in between your 3 non-active characters and starts hitting them, they should hit them back. They would also just watch their buddies get beat on while they are in melee range. I found ranged to be the best usually and default to be about worthless, as well as ""agressive"" I think it was.

5b) I did have this same complaint with mass effect about the AI being generally stupid. I enjoyed it much more though. Although the expansion was a total rip off.

6) Moving around. This was atrocious! On games like this, I should be able to ""warp"" or whatever to any place that I have been at anytime that I am not fighting. But no, there are many times that you have to walk and walk and walk, only to wait for a map load, so you can walk and walk and walk to the far end of the new map to the point where you can finally ""fast move."" Again, here is a great example where the diehards like it b/c ""It took me X hours to beat."" Keep in mind, once you get to a destination, it may take you another walking across a map, loading a new map and walking across another before you get where you want. I remember one time it took me about 15 minutes just to get to a place that I had already been to talk to a person that I had already talked to just to do a side quest.

7) Active quest. If I set a quest as active, it should always tell me where to go if my character knows the location. I may not remember where jonas was, but it will only tell me where he is if I am in the same ""suburb"" of a town that he is in. Again, if I (my character) knows that he is in place X, then give me an arrow leading me to place X. I don't actually want to memorize 20 hours of dialog just to complete a side quest.

8) Replayability. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE. I already know the general storyline, so most of it I may not want to listen too, but it may still take me a minute just to skip through the story. It took me about 14 hours on the replay, and I bet at least 10 of that was story. I am serious about that too.","Good game, but too many problems with it",1259452800,12,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",

It's really hard to describe exactly what makes the game so bad, but mostly it's just that nothing in the game is even remotely interesting or entertaining. The combat is boring and repetitive. They gave Spider-Man weird time-travel powers that allow him to slow down or freeze enemies and beat on them. This power recharges very quickly, and so makes most combat situations trivially-easy to clear. The few boss battles that I've played aren't interesting either. They are boring and repetitive.

When you're not fighting mindless and boring bad guys, then most of the rest of your time is spent crawling through air ducts or following lines of glowing purple score dots from one point to another. Like the designers think the players are too stupid to be able to navigate from point A to point B that they have to line paths with glowing markers.

The time travel elements of the story also come off an an insult to the player's intelligence in most situations. One level early in the game has some barrels of radioactive waste being damaged in the past. This causes the Spider-Man in the future to start suffering from radiation poisoning in the future because in the 90 years in between, noboby in the facility apparently bothered to fix the broken barrels that are leaking radioactive waste. Come on! In other situations, you have to break objects in the past or destroy obstacles in order for you to progress in the future. But almost every time, they beg the question: ""why didn't somebody fix this in the intervening 90 years?!"" Every now and then you might knock down a wall or something like that in the past, which might cause there to be a new room there in the future. This sort of thing makes a little bit more sense, but it doesn't happen nearly as often as the ""destroy something in the past that is causing imminent harm to the character in the future"" situations.

Finally, Neil Patrick Harris has been replaced as the voice actor for Amazing Spider-Man by Josh Keaton, who voiced Ultimate Spider-Man in Shattered Dimensions and in the cartoon Spectacular Spider-Man (which is an awesome show, go buy the season one DVD right now!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Spectacular-Spider-Man-Season-1/dp/B002A5EBLW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Spectacular Spider:Man: Season 1</a>. Keaton worked really well as the younger, teenaged Ultimate and Spectacular Spider-Man(s?), but his whiny, high-pitched voice just sounds wrong for the 30-something-year-old Peter Parker/Spider-Man depicted in this game. This isn't helped by the fact that his delivery is nowhere near as charming as Neil Patrick's was, or that the dialogue itself is very poorly written and boring to listen to.

This game is all-around bad. I do not recommend it for ANYONE. The Spider-Man character and powers have been so badly butchered in this game that I can't even recommend this game to die-hard Spidey fans. If this game had been designed as a 2-player co-op game (either split-screen or online) with one player playing as Amazing Spider-Man and the other as Spider-Man 2099, with the actions by one player in one timeline having an immediate effect on the player in the other timeline, then *maybe* it could have been a decent game. But as it stands, this game is just a mindless rehash or poorly-recycled gameplay from a year ago that is attempting to cash in on people who were waiting for Arkham City to come out.

I love exploration games and while some of the planets can be quite beautiful they all end up just looking like palette swaps since everything else looks the same.

The upgrades for your equipment are plentiful, but they all seem kind of useless. All you will really care about is adding new slots to your Exosuit, ship, and Multi-tool so you can mine more materials.

It's just not worth $60 IMO. Had Hello Games released NMS as a $20 indie game I think it would have been OK to have such a lack of things to do in this game. Games like Proteus prove that there is a fan base for the art inspired exploration for exploration's sake.

Had they come through on everything they promised it would have been a very different game.

**UPDATE**
I've been experiencing numerous lockups and other issues with this game. This rate of freezing and locking up is inexcusable.
It takes the complete fun out of the game when you spend an hour mining a rare mineral only to have the game freeze up before you get a chance to save. It wouldn't be so bad if this only happened every once in a great while, but out of the 30 hours I've put into this game it's probably happened over a dozen times.

2.0,False,"11 15, 2000",A35PRBBMGHNFV3,B000051WA3,Amazon Customer,"Before spending the tremendous amount of money on this game system, I hope you take this review into consideration. As both a DC (dreamcast) and PS2 (playstation 2) owner, I have had the opportunity to critically review each system, and thus I want to share these observations with you. In turn, this review points out the good and the bad of each system, and in the end I will tell you the winning system; so here we go: Hardware: OK, when looking at the PS2's specs on paper compared the DC's, the DC doesnt look good. I won't go into the detail, but I have to say that the PS2 system looks more capable. But then again, what good is a great system, when the system doesn't play great games? The games on the PS2 are just not as good as the comparable games on the DC. I'll go into that more in a little while. But either way, in raw specs, the winner is the PS2. Graphics: many people base their gaming experience purely on graphics, and true, it is very important. Having lush 3d graphics is critical to games today, and the DC and PS2 prove that. The DC shows this in games that peak in game graphics. For instance, hands down, reviewers from ... and people believe that the fighting game Soul Calibur has the greatest graphics in any fighting game ever. The level of detail in the game Shenmue is also astounding. The PS2 also has some great graphics, but they just aren't as good as the dreamcast. This is surprising as Sony reprsentitaves said that the system would produce graphics that make the Dreamcast seem outdated. Game reviewers also feel that the graphics are not on par with the dreamcast. Many have criticized the jaggy lines that are produced from the PS2. I definately noticed this when playing Ridge racer V. It's not that the graphics are bad, it's just that with all the hype that was said about the PS2's AMAZING graphics, it truly doesn't turn out those results. Of course, the Playstation2 is a new system, and many of the GREAT games are yet to come. But then again, Soul Calibur came out at the start of the DC's release. Thus, the dreamcast wins in this area over the PS2.
Sound: the winner of this section is so hard to say. It really is hard to say. It depends on the game and also your TV. Because of this, they both are equal.
Games: another very hard section to review. Naturally, the DC is the clear winner. I has been out longer, and thus has had time to produce ASTONISHING games that have REVOLUTIONIZED the gaming world. The PS2 has just been released, and the system does have same pretty darn good games. But they just don't compare the DC's comparable games. This idea is unanamous between all professional reviewers. In sports, the DC rocks with NFL 2k1, Soul Calibur is the most accaladed game ever made, Shenmue was the most expensive game made and is also the most detailed, etc. The DC is the clear winner, and will be for A LONG time until the PS2 can come up with some games that are in the same league as the DC.
Features: so, you like the DVD player on the PS2? Or the modem on the DC? What system excells in features where the other does not? Well, the DVD player on the PS2 is a great feature. But it also has many downsides. First of all, is it really great to play DVD's on a regular, sub-average TV with no surround sound, which is what most people own? NO. That is what your credit card will say to you when you buy all your new DVD's along with your tremendously high system. But, if you have the money and the equipment, this is a great feature. Another downside of the PS2 is that the system is not capable of holding 4 controlers, you have to buy yet another product to do so. Annoing, isn't it? The PS2 will have a broadband modem in about 2 years. Ask yourself something: what good is a modem on your PS2 when you'll be playing some new and better system then? 2 years is a long time to wait for that modem, and it really is important. The other accessories, like rumble packs, memory cards, etc, are good. The DC has a built in modem that allows you to surf the net, play your video games, send e-mail....all for free! Playing video games online is truly an amazing feature, and is worthwile if there are no friends over at your house. Unfortanately, there are only a handful of games utilizing this technology, but MANY more are on the way. The DC also has 4 controler slots, plays CD's, etc. It doesn't have the DVD player, though, and also has some terrible add-on products like some of the rumble packs you can purchase. The winner of this category is the DC, because it's more capable of it's technology NOW, and also doesn't require other expensive stuff like a great TV and surround sound to utilize it's features. So who is the winner at the end? The clear winner is the DC! Yes, the DC. It has been out longer so it has things the PS2 does not, and also is packed with amazing games and graphics that just plain and simply beat out the PS2. Also check out the price tag: it's half the price of the PS2. Look, the PS2 does have good qualities, but the hype and biased opinions made the system something it's not. That's why I gave it 2 stars. It does have some great games and the DVD player is neat, so it does deserve some credit. But trust me when I say go get a DC, not a PS2, its definately worth it and you can spend the extra money you didn't use for some more great games.

2.0,True,"11 4, 2014",A38EAEOIEWZS0F,B00KSQACMM,C.J.,"UPDATE: 03/15/16

The plastics on these things are terrible.  Not only have both extension arms broken on my pair, but so have 2 of my friends' pairs.  My pair hung on the extremely over-priced stand from Turtle Beach and were never under ""undue"" stress.  I've since epoxied mine back together and have looked to brace them with a thin metal exo skeleton on the arms, but this should not have been necessary.  Due to the price, this is necessary to avoid wasting a LOT of money.  Do yourself a favor and skip these.

While the sound on these things are indeed excellent, you won't be able to here anything when the cups are bowed away from your ears due to the inferior plastics.

UPDATE 11/7/14:

TLDR:  Sound great, usability is weak.

The Details:

The sound is top notch and the ability to hear yourself in the headset is a huge plus.  I've heard little details that I have never heard before.  I've got a pretty nice audio set up with Martin Logan speakers in front and Pinnacle 3-Element speakers in the rear all being pushed by an Elite receiver and an SVS cylinder for low end.  In order to hear this level of detail from my set up, I would have to crank the volume to a level that wouldn't be acceptable in a family home.  These cans put the audio right next to your ear without it sounding like you're standing next to a speaker.

The mic is sensitive enough that, when combined with the 3 levels of personal audio, I can hear most of the things going on in the house even though I've got the cans on.  This is a big plus for anyone with kids.  I haven't really played with all of the various pre-sets on these things yet, because I found the default to be quite good.

All is not roses and rainbows however:

Charging is a problem as described by other reviewers.  (most disconcerting is the lack of a removable battery pack)  Over-all the buttons on the mic side can are harder to manage than the other side due to the mic protruding from the center of the can.  A better design would have put the mic on the edge.  The center mount is only necessary if the cans were reversible but they are not.  The angle of the cups makes wearing in the opposite direction a little odd and the direction of sound would be reversed (no option to switch).  This of course would mandate the personal audio wheel be relocated, but that is a design concern.  Oddly, the mic side ear cup is smaller than the other.  This isn't TOO big of a deal, but you will likely feel your ear touch the inside of the cup.  (when I wore in reverse to test this, understanding these are not reversible, my other ear touched the inside of the cup.  I measured depth to verify.)

The only odd occurrence with audio is when I first start using them.  Each time, my party says I sound distant or muffled.  Within a couple of minutes, the issue resolves itself with no adjustment from me, so I am not 100% on the cause.

Over-all, if I could, I would give these 4.5 stars.  Since I can't, I am going with 4 stars.

Because this is not Turtle Beach's first outing with headset design, it is a little annoying that they haven't added simple things larger volume wheels, more tactile buttons, and a separate controller mounted puck for quick muting and volume control.  (The lack of controller mounted puck with mute and volume control means you have to relinquish the controller to make adjustments on the mic side can making their use during game play a little cumbersome.)  At this price point their 15$ stand should have been included.  Those things did not, however, influence the loss of a star.

UPDATE 11/6/14:
Turtle Beach released additional information for failed firmware and a method for getting the device into bootloader mode for a clean install.  The information can be found at the following:

[...]

I had to follow clear to the last step before there was success.  My gear is now at the following versions:

Transmitter (1.2.3)
Headset (1.0.5

The 1 star rating is now a 2.  I will update again in a day or two once I have had time to actually put these things through their paces.  It is nice that Turtle Beach recognized an issue with their headset, not so nice that their promised business day response time was not followed through.  More to come.

OLD:
I pre-ordered these things as soon as I learned about them.  It's hard to believe a truly wireless headset didn't come with the One, and odd that it took so long for one to be released.  (and the premium... ouch)

The reason for the one star:  Bricked.  Opening the package, I decided to RTFM.  The first thing is says is to update the headset.  So I hop on Turtle Beach's website, download their v2.0.4 Ear Force Audio Hub and install it.  It updates immediately to v2.0.5.  It says ""...please attach a Turtle Beach device..."" so I plug the headset in.  The computer updates a driver and the Turtle Beach tool immediately hangs on ""Loading Device"" then goes to ""Load Device Failed."" while advising me to disconnect and reconnect the device.

After a couple rounds of plugging in and unplugging, I sift through the Turtle Beach site and find that I need to plug in both the Transmitter AND the Headset.  Fair enough, my mistake just doing the headset.  I plug in the transmitter first and it recognizes the device.  It then updates the firmware, as expected, and then prompts me to plug in the headset, which I do.  No joy.  Same issue.  I unplug and re-plug the device.  Still no joy.  I then unplug both and plug them back in.  Now neither device is recognized.

I thought, ok.. maybe it still works, it just won't update.  I plug everything into the One as directed by the instructions.  The transmitter just flashes LEDs 2 and 4 without ever going solid.  I can find no literature on this flashing.  I am now dead in the water with what is essentially a DOA device.

All instructions were followed as written online at their website and in the provided documentation.  I can hear some of you saying ""But this isn't a review of the HEADSET!""  Actually, it is.  There was no external or negative test case here.  This headset was provisioned and installed as documentation dictated.  I submitted a trouble ticket to Turtle Beach and am waiting to hear back from them.  If/when I hear back, I will update this review.  For the time being, I am stuck with a 250$ paper weight set.",UPDATE 3 ... broken plastics and inferior quality,1415059200,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Frustrating game for alt-aholics like me. Housing is instanced but a limited number of total lots (unless they changed it since I played last), so if you aren't filthy rich, you will probably never own a house. Also, by default you are forced to play dungeons with strangers and queue as your class's role unless you have 3 friends to go with you (then you can all play whatever class you fancy so long as you go to the dungeon together). The mount requires doing dungeons, so if you're shy like me or nervous about not playing your class right / getting yelled at for not knowing a dungeon or boss mechanics / being blacklisted by the majority-awful fanbase, no free mount for you. And you'll miss a lot of plot too if I remember right, if you skip dungeons... dunno, haven't wanted to play in ages.

+Good Graphics with Prog scan and Widescreen support this is very pleasing, the character models are nice as well.

+A lively atmosphere, people go about their daily business and it seems very ""real"", everyone isn't just standing around waiting for you to talk to them like most RPGs. Also armour that you buy actually appears on your character in-game.

+Combat with 3 other allies is decent if unspectacular, real time combat is always nice and gives you a feeling of being part of a team.

-I strugled to get past the 30 hour mark, it becomes very predictable and you forget it as soon as you stop playing.

-Allies can never be equipped or have any stat changed, this is a single hero game.

Lets start with the MP Pros and Cons.
CONS
-Playing solo is a nightmare. Teamwork allows for easy power weapon hogging and steam rolling uncoordinated teams.
-Slayer maps are badly designed. Too many long sightlines, paths, and not suited for dashes/clambering. Youll hardly ever get to see your attacker until its too late.
-BR/DMR fights are nonexistent. Its whoever gets the jump on the other who wins, no more gun fights.
-Weird weapon balancing. EVERY weapon is deadly barely any use for BR, DMR, or Carbine close up.
-Maps have too many power weapons that spawn too quickly. Probably because they want fast paced matches similar to other fps.
PROS
-Warzone Assault is for the competitive players. Expertly designed and balanced. Very fair and not too crazy. Fun with friends!
-Reqs not too intrusive. I ignored them all and I didn't feel like I missed anything.
-Forge is insane and bound to make some of the best Halo maps yet. Expect multiplayer overhaul if community maps get into playlists.
-While fast paced and not like Halo, it does play very well in BTB and Warzone. But stay away from TS and other game modes as they are too crazy.

Now for the campaign. Personally, THIS is the worst Halo campaign and is responsible for the low rating. Played it first on legendary solo.
PROS
-They nailed the covenant in this game. Elites are toned down, but its so refreshing just to fight them after the fustrating prometheans.
-Buck makes a return
-The game is beautiful
-THE BEST map design in all of Halo. So many paths and secrets!
-Cool easter eggs and flavor text.
CONS
-AWFUL AI. The game is designed around them and assumes they will watch your back. Instead of feeling like you're a part of an elite force you feel like you're picking up your ""team's"" slack.
-TERRIBLE BOSSES. 343 did not take notes and made one of the worst bosses in video games. Armored bullet sponge with multiple instant kill moves.
-BORING OST. Walk Softly is the only song that tries to stand out.
-BAD STORY. Youre on wild goosechase the entire time and know the game's twist from the start. Lame dialogue. (Besides Buck)
-The prometheans are back and more boring than ever. Theyre still bullet sponges and expect to sniped by suppressors constantly. Too strong and not very intelligent.
-I hope you like Suppresors. Theyre amazing and in constantly supply.
-MERIDIAN SUCKS. A glasses planet sounds cool but it isn't actually. This is only made worse after the next con.
-REINFORCEMENTS/PADDING. The missions are shorter but each room is filled with 2-5 waves of reinforcments when fighting prometheans. You will hate it.

The feeling is is that this game is BS.

This game is not bad, but it is not a finished product - it is a kind of a brilliant term paper project with SO many essential pieces missing or badly implemented that it almost becomes nonsensical. However, keep in mind that there are only two guys responsible for the entire game, so sincere KUDOS to them. Yet, sentiment aside, evaluating the game solely on its merits and flaws, it is a 2-star game. Explanations follow.

== See the list of missing or poorly implemented features at the end of the review ==

INTRO:

FTL is not a game completely without merit (hence 2 stars instead of 1). It has potential. It is a decent idea and some of it is good, but overall, in spite of having potential (see?), this game isn't worth a dime (unless you enjoy endlessly replaying games which you are unable to finish). By the way, you can get FTL on GOG for 4 bucks if you wait a bit for another sale (like I did) and it will be Steam DRM-free.

The 'addictive' nature of this game so many mention in their reviews comes from the developer's understanding of elementary human psychology 101: You crave what you can't have. And in this game what you can't have is victory. It is a carrot on a stick trick where the juicy carrot dangles so very close to you that you can almost taste it, but no matter how much you crave it and drool you just can't quite reach it, but you keep trying...

Just look around on the web for user reviews. Even those who rate it highly admit that you will likely fail to beat the game (even if you can get to the Last Stand mission in one piece in the first place). You WILL fail to complete your mission and finish the game 27 out of 30 playthroughs on the easiest difficulty. I can confirm that. Having played it 31 times on Easy I managed to complete it only three times... and I promise you - when I did manage to finish the game it was NOT because I learned the game and got good at it. It was simple blind luck of the (card) draw. My first victory came on the third play-through. The next one came around the 15th attempt; and the third time I was victorious was around attempt 22 or thereabouts. The rest of the time I lost NOT because I was bad (come on, I beat it on the third try initially, right?) but because I could not get what I needed to win. In one play-through I could not find ANY weapon upgrades (except for a powerful missile launcher) in ANY stores at all. My original lasers + this weapon launcher were enough to fight my way to the final boss, but the three lasers simply cannot get through the boss ship's shields fast enough and its defense drones can easily shoot down your missiles rendering the missile launcher mostly useless.. so you end up in this situation simply because you could not buy the necessary upgrades.

Here's why I give this game only 2 stars:

---------

Firstly, you are Flying Blind: You are on the run from the rebel fleet to deliver some vital information to the Federation fleet... and you only know the general direction you need to fly in (from the left to the right of the sector map). Mind you, you are not USS Voyager lost in the Delta quadrant knowing nothing about the space there. Instead, you are a Federation ship flying through mostly well-explored and well-charted Federation space (save for a few uncharted nebulae); yet you have NO idea where the Star Bases are (called Stores in FTL) where you can repair and resupply (well, there's only one Star Base in the game and it is not usable at all; the stores are some traveling merchants or black market outlets). And even if you install the Long-Range Scanner augment you can still only see a couple of jump points ahead. So you have zero ability to plan your flight path intelligently (Astrometrics lab anyone?). Each sector and the entire universe is always randomly generated (which is a good thing, actually) but your absolute inability to navigate through it intelligently is frustrating.

Granted, sometimes you get help, like once I was 'invited' aboard a friendly ship and spied a detailed sector map. Another play-through I bumped (by accident) into THREE mercenary ships who sold me detailed sector maps... but during most play-throughs I did not get ANY of that kind of help and was, essentially, flying blindly and randomly. Give you a couple of examples of why this is bad:

1. Say, you have a ton of scrap (used to purchase weapons and equipment and to upgrade your ship) - you've been saving it for a shopping spree - but you have no way to spend it because you don't know where the Stores are. Say, at some point a store lights up on your map but you can't get to it (for whatever reason). Or two stores light up... but you have no way of contacting them to see what they have for sale...(subspace communications anyone?) and you can't get to both of the stores... So you must, again, pick a Store at random and HOPE that they have what you need.

Or you ARE able to get to both stores so you go to Store 1, see something decent there and you buy it. You buy it for fear that Store 2 may not have anything usable and you won't be able to return to Store 1 because the rebel fleet will be already there by the time you return... then you go to Store 2 and they actually DO have what you really, really need/want, but you have not enough scrap to buy it (since you had already spent it in Store 1). So this is 'game over' most of the time because if you don't find what you need to win further on in the game, well, you can't win.

2. Completing achievements (and consequently unlocking new ships and things) also suffers from Flying Blind. Here's what happened with me during my last playthrough (which broke the camel's back and prompted me to write this review): I was playing with the Stealth Cruiser and going for the achievement where you reach the final sector (Sector 8) without having flown through a single hazardous area of space (such as asteroid belts). Guess what? It wasn't easy but I managed to avoid all hazardous areas until I jumped to Sector 7. Once there, I had only two jump points available to me and BOTH lead into asteroid belts (so much for the achievement and the Long Range Scanner which is installed on the Stealth Cruiser by default). Achievements should be achievable through careful and intelligent actions by the player. If achieving something (or failing to achieve it) is randomly dictated and set up by the game and the player has NO say in it whatsoever, these outcomes CANNOT and SHOULD NOT be called achievements. They should be called ""blind luck accidental outcomes"" or something like that. You will unlock achievements (accidentally). Good friggin' luck unlocking them intentionally.

But it gets worse. Though I was lucky to have found (and equipped) top of the line weapons (two Burst Laser Mark III - yay!) this time around and no ship could stand up to me, when I finally engaged the final boss all of my weapons miraculously missed... TWICE in a row completely wasting my Cloak. So I took a lot of damage, Cloak and Shields destroyed, without doing any damage to the boss ship and I lost... for the 27th time...

This game is NOT difficult or challenging. It is a completely unfair and random draw of cards where the House (almost) always wins. FTL is an ultimate exercise in futile and unsatisfying waste of time. Again, your success or failure does not depend on what you do. It depends on what cards you are dealt by the computer completely at random. Of course, you can make mistakes and lose because of that, but most of the time you will still lose even if you don't make any mistakes at all.

---------

Secondly, the replay value is only there for as long as you think you can get better at the game; as long as you think there's something you don't understand or not doing right. Once you realize that you are guaranteed to lose if you fail to GUESS correctly what to upgrade *now* and what you will be able to upgrade *later*, you realize that the replay value is a mirage. Certain systems and weapons work well with other systems and weapons but others don't. So if X works well with Y but not with Z and you upgrade X but never get Y you are guaranteed to lose the game. For example, if you buy and equip the Fire Beam or the Pike Beam you need to install a reliable means of destroying enemy shields. Otherwise the above weapons are useless. So if you don't find such means you are screwed.

Now, you cannot hoard the scrap indefinitely because you cannot get too far without upgrades; so if you find nothing worth buying in the first few Stores and the enemies get progressively harder, you have to spend some scrap on systems' upgrades (such as Shields or Cloak) just to stay alive *right now*. Once you get to a store where you can buy an upgrade for a weapon (or a new weapon), etc. you kind of have to get it, hoping that other useful things will become available later, but they may not... or they will but you won't have enough scrap to buy them...

Upgrading everything requires systems upgrades and reactor power upgrades. ALL upgrades cost A LOT of scrap. Since your options are always severely limited and your inventory is VERY, VERY small you have to do the best you can with what you've got at the moment and sometimes you have to sell decent weapons because you are SO far away from being able to use them that it is best to get/upgrade something else. So you end up getting rid of things that *may* come in handy later just to be able to survive *right now*... if you don't - it is 'game over' at the next jump point (beacon).

In the game I mentioned above (where I was unable to get any usable weapon upgrades) I was so badly damaged at one point that I knew if I did not upgrade the engines, shields and cloak I would not survive the next engagement regardless of the power of my weapons and that I would never get a chance to reach a Store to repair and resupply, so I had to spend the scrap on the systems upgrades. And, sure enough, I made it to the Store and they had good stuff but I had no scrap to buy it... The rest of the stores I encountered either had NO weapons at all or they had the wrong weapons.

The bottom line is that I ended up in the final (boss) battle with tons of shields, cloak and engine power and other systems upgrades but inadequate firepower to take down the boss ship. Similar scenarios unfold in 90% of the replays you attempt.

---------

Thirdly, combat is actually BORING. Yes, I've said it. Once you figure out two simple things (which should not take long) it becomes repetitive and boring:

1. When fighting other ships you may think you should get creative and target various systems like shields, life support, engines, etc. But you should not. If you have decent firepower you should always target enemy weapons. If their weapons are damaged or disabled they cannot shoot at you. Just keep firing at their weapons control and eventually you will win. If you don't have the ability to take down their weapons, you can't take down ANY system on their ship and you don't stand a chance.

2. When fighting enemy boarding parties all you need to do is move your entire crew into the medical bay and if your crew is large to the room right next to the med bay. Then open all hatches and doors to vent the air out of the ship (except the doors in the med bay and the room next to it, of course). The enemies, not wanting to suffocate, will abandon their plans to damage or destroy your systems and they will run to the med bay. Your crew in the med bay are healed automatically as they take damage, so they can kill an infinite number of enemies. Of course, if your med bay is destroyed or damaged or you are unable to power it this will not work, but then nothing will - enemy boarding parties are always a lot stronger than your guys. Even if you fight off the intruders without the healing of the med bay you will lose at least half of your crew and this is 'game over' as there is no recovering from this kind of loss.

VERDICT:

I'd say get FTL 2 if it ever comes out and if it is more balanced, more reasonable and a little more of a sandbox where you can actually apply some tactical and strategic thinking. In this game you can't.

---------

LIST OF MISSING (OR POORLY IMPLEMENTED) FEATURES (as I see it)

- Inability to take deliberate steps to acquire sector navigation information (you only get it accidentally, if at all).

- Inability to communicate with Stores/bases or other ships (you can 'hail' other ships ONLY in scripted events, not of your own volition).

- TINY storage bays (inventory) on ships.

- TINY augmentation capacity. You have space for only three augmentations. Okay. Fine. But if they give room for only three, you should be able to store unused augmentations in the inventory. For example, Long Range Scanner is only useful before you reach sector 8. You have NO use for it whatsoever during the Last Stand mission. You should be able to remove it and install something useful, like Automated Reloader (reduces weapons cooldown by 15%) before going into the final battle.

- Inability to sell missiles or drone parts (if you are finding only beam and laser weapons and have no use for missiles, you should be able to sell them at Stores; right now you CAN sell missiles and drone parts or exchange them for fuel or the other way around but only in random places which you may or may not bump into).

- Inability to buy back sold items - sometimes your arithmetic may falter and you realize you should not have sold 'that' weapon. You should be able to buy it back.

- Game is programmed so that no matter how hard you try you cannot get certain augments for certain ships. For example, I have never seen a Cloak Generator available in any stores when playing with The Osprey ship. Everything should be installable on ANY ship.

- You should be able to assess the probability of succeeding or failing in resolving random events. Right now random events can randomly have positive or negative outcomes and nothing depends on you at all.

- You should be able to decide which members of your crew go on away missions; I don't want to send my fully trained helmsman or weapons officer on a dangerous away mission as losing either of them closer to the end game will cause you to lose (as the untrained weapons officer will be unable to hit the boss ship, for example).

- Uncharted nebulae, while full of various hazards, should provide a means of evading the rebel fleet. However, EVERY SINGLE uncharted nebula says something like ""The rebel fleet was prepared for this nebula, so it won't provide a good hiding place"". This makes uncharted nebulae useless (you just avoid them), reducing tactical/strategic opportunities.

- There should be fewer hostile ships and more friendly ships. Right now 9 out of 10 ships you encounter are hostile, even among the Federation members - nearly every frigging Zoltan, Mantis, Slug, Rock or Engi ship is a frigging pirate or slave trader or just 'ignores' your hails (as in you are not really hailing anyone, you just get a message like 'a ship is coming in, weapons hot, they are refusing all hails...').

- You should be able to control your Boarding (attack) and Antipersonnel (defense) drones. Right now they attack randomly and you have zero control over them. If there are two enemy boarding parties on your ship you want to send the drone to attack the more dangerous one while your crew deal with the less dangerous party. If you launch your boarding drone at the enemy ship you want it to attack the system which you need damaged or destroyed to give you some advantage, not a random room with random equipment. You aim your weapons. Right? Why can't you program the drone to do something you want instead of doing something completely at random?

- The same goes for System Repair drones which will repair damaged ship systems at random. If my weapons are damaged I want THAT repaired ASAP as the damaged Sensors can wait (especially in a nebula where sensors are inoperable).

- The same goes for Defense and Anti-ship drones. If I want my defense drone to focus on shooting down incoming missiles and ignore incoming laser bursts (say I have enough shields to absorb the laser fire) I should be able to do just that. If I want the Anti-ship drones to focus on enemy shield generator, that's what I should be able to program them with. The ship system is called Drone Control after all, so you should be able to control them drones...

- You should be able to resupply at the Federation Star Base in Sector 8 and potentially sell off obsolete equipment and get some weapons and systems there (it is a friggin' Star Base for Christ's sake, not some traveling merchant). Right now the base won't even repair your hull to full health if you are very badly damaged when you arrive there (it looks like they will only repair about 15 points of hull damage before sending you after the boss ship).

- OUT OF FUEL! You can sit and wait for a passing ship to trade with or you can send out a distress signal which may attract enemies. This is COOL! BUT... when an automated refueling ship arrives it offers one unit of emergency fuel for free or more fuel at premium prices (in scrap). This is also COOL! What's NOT cool is that while you are sitting in space out of fuel you cannot see ANYTHING on the sector map aside from the huge NO FUEL sign. How many a time I had to buy lots of fuel expending oh-so-valuable scrap just to find out, once refueled, that there is a Store only one jump (one unit of fuel which I could get for free) away and that I could, in fact, save a ton of scrap by purchasing fuel at the Store... What? OUT OF FUEL means your scanners are not working? Does not make sense...

- Hull damage/No hull damage... There are weapons in the game (such as Small Bomb) which are teleported onto a ship, attach themselves to a targeted system and do damage to the system and the personnel in that room, but they do NO hull damage. At the same time, when enemy boarding parties damage or destroy a system on your ship, the ship DOES take hull damage. This makes no sense.

- By the way, enemy boarding parties are ALWAYS a lot stronger than your best trained security forces

- Speaking about teleporting/boarding - the fact that teleporting is possible while the shields are UP goes against all Sci-Fi lore (such as Star Trek, etc.) I am sure you know that the patterns of teleported items/individuals are scrambled by energy shields (at least in all the Sci-Fi we know and there are pseudo scientific reasons for that). Why this is ignored in this game is beyond me... Makes no sense for a Federation starship captain if you ask me...

The list of nonsense really goes on. Like I said earlier, this game has potential, but so many things are missing or poorly implemented that it is hard to recommend this game to anyone who wants to think and act like a Starship captain with a tactical and strategic brain in their skull.

i have played the PC version of Mass Effect far enough to get all the characters but quit after that. The biggest reason is technical. i've double checked a couple of times now and my system exceeds the recommended specs and i still get single digit frame rates, even with all the options turned low. This is surprising given that Mass Effect is nowhere near as pretty as other games that play just fine on my PC (Bioshock, Gears of War, Stranglehold, etc.). i don't normally have problems playing games, but this one is ridiculously slow. At a minimum, they should change their minimum and recommended specs.

The game is unstable, and when it crashes, it tends to crash your whole system. It's been a long time since i've had to reboot my PC three times an hour. i've installed the patch and done all the standard things (latest drivers, etc.) but this game just doesn't want to stay up. i know some of the problems are related to the anti-copying Secure-ROM software (which many people here have already said is unethical; at a minimum, it should tell users it will be installed and give them a way to uninstall it when they uninstall the game). My review isn't based on the ethics of Secure-ROM but i can say that it's caused me to reboot at least once. Most problems, though, i'm guessing are because the port from XBox to PC wasn't done very well.

As for the game, it's your standard Bioware game. You've probably played others and know if you like them or not. They're not for everyone. If you look at their history, Bioware has slowly moved from making role-playing games to making movies. It's well known to game designers that it's hard to get both a strong plot and open, flexible gameplay. Some games try hard (e.g., GTA) but Bioware realizes its talent is in story telling, not graphics, AI or level design (none of which the game does well; the AI is a surprising step backwards from Jade Empire but still better then KotOR). Continuing that trend, Mass Effect is a lot like watching cut scenes with occasional game play. Oddly, a lot of that game play is first person shooter. Bioware does not make good first person shooters. With the FPS aspect, the game actually feels a lot like Deus Ex, a game many people liked, but not as an FPS.

The story, characters, quests, etc. are probably pretty good. i can't say i'm in love with many of the characters (Rex is OK, but not as much fun as HK-47 or Boo). It doesn't seem as good as Jade Empire but it does offer significantly more places to explore than that game did. The love plot, a staple of all recent Bioware games, isn't done very well here (at least when i played a female character). i can't tell you how the game story, subquests, etc. turn out over the long run because i gave up on the game (80% technical reasons, 20% boredom).

As always, the graphics are serviceable but not impressive. Levels are linear and make the world feel very small (Bioware has a talent at making a major city feel like it was the size of an average high school). You still can only select two allies and you have no control over them. That's always been a ridiculous limitation which i assume they use to compensate for the poor pathfinding. Bioware AI tends to be towards the bottom end of the AAA game developers.

But you don't buy a Bioware game to, um, play a game. Bioware games are epic stories containing characters with character. If you liked previous Bioware games (or Deus Ex) and don't mind the new console FPS-like combat system, you'll probably enjoy this game.

The grappling system is very unrealistic: one thing I loved about LOW2 is that you needed to be in the proper position to do a certain move. Here, like so many other lazy wrestling games, your character just does the move on autopilot.

* The roster is anemic. There are about 30 total superstars. Given the pantheon of wrestlers in the last three decades, there should be many more. A few wrestlers are added via DLC, but not many.

* The game can't even let you have a proper tag team match! You cannot tag out, you are all in the ring together. Seems like an extremely lazy design choice.

* No Royal Rumble, No Survivor Series, and a really dumb version of the Cage Match (which makes absolutely no difference)

* Furthermore, the game offers what appears to be a wide variety of matches, but there's really no difference in the end: everyone comes after you. Even if its a battle royal match, everyone targets you. This is especially annoying when you consider the clunky switch-target control. Often you're getting the crap beat out of you while your grapplers attention is elsewhere.

* This game has the absolute DUMBEST use of a signature move. Your character will not DO the move, but stands there, completely vulnerable, showboating for the crowd for about 4 seconds (at which time your opponent can [and often does] ruin the move with a single punch)... and even if you make it, your grappler will often grapple the WRONG DIRECTION and waste the move.

* Some games like Legends of Wrestling: Showdown were very, very obviously rushed and very little effort put into the game, with no vignettes, story or any kind of atmosphere. This game has three brief (but very nicely done) challenge vignettes -- the Undertaker's, in particular, was good. There is a nice little thread of comparing the old and the new, which leads to most of the unlockables.

Altogether, it's not the worst wrestling game, but it's not really anything special. If they would have spent a few more months adding content, polishing, and (especially) adding different match types that were actually different, this would be far better.

I've been a fan of the little yellow guy for years now and I've been quite interested in the games as well. Battle For Bikini Bottom might be one of the best Video Game adaptations of a TV show ever, while the Spongebob Movie game and Truth or Square were almost just as good. But Plankton's Robotic Revenge might stand as the worst Spongebob Game to date.
Let's start out with the good. The graphics are without a doubt the best seen in a spongebob game, though that isn't saying a lot. The Character Models are decent but the levels are just a step above bland. The voice acting is perfect because they got the actual voice actors from the TV show to play them, which is pretty impressive.
Now for the bad. The story is nothing exciting, as it's introduced by a cut scene less than a minute long detailing plankton stealing the secret Krabby Patty formula with some help of his robot buddies. This is probably the most exciting part of the game because it's the only part even somewhat reminiscent of the TV Show. Another incredibly disappointing aspect of this game is the level design. It might just be the worst I have ever played in a game. It's incredibly dull and repetitive and has almost nothing to do with the rest of the spongebob universe.
The gameplay is almost as dull as the level design. Within the first 15 minutes of the game you will have unlocked the first gun which is literally the only weapon you will need over the course of the game. In order to kill enemies you will need to use your melee attack which is useless to the point that the only time you will use it is to smash barrels, or to shoot them by holding down the shoot button and the auto-aim does the rest. One level, I seriously sat at one end of the field, held down the shoot button, closed my eyes and it killed all the enemies.
I really wanted to like this game. I loved Battle For Bikini Bottom, Truth or Square and The Movie Game. But this was just horrible. It was incredibly uninspired and the only even kind of appealing thing about this game is the characters from the TV show with original voice acting. Avoid this one at all costs.

Pros.
+ Voice Acting From The TV Show
+ Good Character Design

Cons.
- Awful Level Design
- Mindless Combat
- Insanely Repetitive
- Repetitive Dialogue
- Not Much Longer Than The Spongebob Movie
- Offers Almost No Challenge Whatsoever

An internet search reveals this to be a far too frequent problem. When this happens, the trigger no longer springs back in place and hangs lopsided. Also in this state it's partially pressed so games requiring finesse becomes problematic. I purchased replacement triggers and the first of 5 (pack) broke again after 3 weeks. I'm not an aggressive gamer so this is definitely a fault.

Another problem has to do with updates. If an update is released, the system refuses to connect online until this update has been downloaded and installed. The problem is most of these updates cause numerous problems, some even cause the system to be nonfunctional. They are eventually fixed after a few days or weeks but you are still forced to download them if you want to play online.

Beyond these problems, the system is fairly decent. The controller in particular has a headphone jack which I find extremely useful, but I am yet to find any use for the touch pad. The controller's battery life is also fairly short.

Final verdict, it may be best to wait for the PS4 slim if you can. The number of soon-to-be-released (2015) games that are exclusive to the system can probably be counted on a single hand, the controller needs to be redone, the software needs to be more stable and the network needs to be more structurally sure. If you still want to get a PS4 now, then pick up a pack of spare R2 triggers while you're at it (I suggest 10).

Three stars - somewhat playable by today's standards, but there's better fare out there

""Mickey Mousecapade"", the first of a series of highly successful Capcom games using Disney trademarks, was published by Capcom in Nintendo but actually developed Hudson Soft in Japan. It the only Capcom published Disney game not actually developed by Capcom. Several sprites from the game are directly lifted from other Hudson Soft games.

""Mickey Mousecapade"" is certainly one of the more obscure titles in the Capcom library. The game has some rather ugly graphics (even for an NES title), but the game certainly has its own style of charm.

There are numerous regional differences between the Japanese and North American versions. The stage bosses are all different between the two versions, and so is much of the enemy roster. The Japanese version is more heavily based on ""Alice in Wonderland"".

The plot of the game is to rescue a friend of Mickey and Minni, who turns out to be Alice of ""Alice in Wonderland"". The final boss is Maleficent from ""Sleeping Beauty"" in the US versiona nd the Queen of Hears from ""Alice in Wonderland"" in the Japanese version. Pete, who is often the final boss in Disney games, is the fourth boss in the American version.

Strangely enough, there is a Hidden Mickey embedded in the circuit board, clearly visible when the game cartridge is disassembled.

Like the NES ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer"", the graphics are ugly and primitive.  Although published in Japan in 1987, ""Mickey Mousecapade"" was published in 1988 in North America, the same year ""Ninja Gaiden"", ""Blaster Master"" and ""The Guardian Legend"" were published.  The grapchis are so bad the game looks like an NES launch title rather than one published later.

Ultimately, Capcom's other Disney games far outshine this title.  Unless you are nostalgic for this title, the NES offers much better fare than this.  Although to be fair, the NES also offers much WORST fare than this game as well.

While Mickey Mousecapade does offer some enjoyment, I would recommend ""Duck Tales"", ""Duck Tales 2"", ""Chip and Dale"", ""Chip and Dale 2"", ""Little Mermaid"", ""Aladdin"", or ""The Jungle Book"" over this travesty.

The video game website IGN rated this title as the 877h greatest game on their top 100 NES games of all time.

(For those looking for great unknown NES/Famicom games, you simply MUST play ""Moon Crystal"", a criminally unknown Famicom exclusive.  The graphics are astounding with cutscenes that even outdo ""Ninja Gaiden"", amazing music, in depth gameplay, and a fantastic storyline.  Absolutely amazing! Had this been released in the US for the NES, I feel it would be as revered as the other heavy hitters in the NES canon)

2.0,True,"04 25, 2014",A195GMC8TGVQWL,B0081Q58AW,Jon,"This game takes some getting used to, but overall I'd say it has potential, but isn't worth a subscription.

On the plus side, the quests aren't too terribly boring, the voice acting is quite good, the graphics are very good for an MMO, and once you get used to the oddities of the gearing system, you can appreciate how flexible your main character really is. The story eventually gets interesting enough to keep your attention (and there is a story, which is a rarity for many MMOs these days). The world is quite large and well-done, and you're not bogged down by a boring shooting gallery of trash mobs.

On the downside, I was confused by how the classes blend together at first (you select a class but then can equip whatever you want, although it's best to equip a little of every type of ability/armor), but once you get used to it, I suppose the flexibility is liberating. I also didn't like how the game drops you in the middle of nowhere as an amnesiac with uncertain loyalties - I much prefer how most MMOs let you know who and what you're fighting for. The interface is very different from other MMOs (very RPG-like) and while there's a lot to explore, there aren't nearly enough quests to feel like you have the freedom to go where you want and do what you want. You're very much on rails.

On the PvP side, there's one PvP zone and it's monstrously huge - so monstrously huge that it's impossible to get anywhere or do anything by yourself. I just don't like oversized WPvP - I prefer the instanced PvP of games like WoW that don't waste your time running everywhere and force you to group into artificial teams and battle against castles and NPCs.

Overall, I'd say there's a lot of potential here, but it lacks a lot of polish and doesn't play as well for an MMO as it should. Even more than SWTOR, the game - with its amorphous class roles, separate stories and no obvious prompting to group for most of the content - plays better as a single player RPG than an MMO. Still, it's a lot of fun so far, but there's simply not enough content to warrant a subscription for this MMO.

2.0,False,"06 9, 2008",AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B000S1MMIE,Aiex Halo,"The Good:

The game is phenomenal with graphics, even for created superstars.  The movelist is sensational, and tremendous.  There's even moves you'll never see in the WWE, such as the Canadian Destroyer, Asai DDT, Shooting Star Press, and others.  The setup of wrestler classes provides for some fun pseudo-finisher bonuses (like the Powerhouse Rampage or the Showstopper finisher stealer) and make for more interesting play.

There's an intensely big variety of matches, and some innovative ways of building up your created superstar to a score of 100 (the highest WWE superstar is John Cena with 97, the lowest Snitsky and Shane McMahon with 82, and the divas are below 70).

The Bad:

For one, what really killed my momentum as a new player was the reversing of the trigger buttons; for the Gamecube, R was to reverse strikes, L was to reverse grapples.  It's reversed here.  As well, button mashing appears to be the same disoriented mess that it was in Day of Reckoning 2; that is, it tries not to encourage button mashing, but doesn't really have any other option... perhaps ""slowly"" mashing the buttons?  It doesn't even really matter because your chances of getting up quickly after just one hit are far slimmer than they would be in DOR2.

I was amazed, amused, and annoyed when starting with WWF Wrestlemania X8, you could break up moves in progress by attacking the people involved, or hitting them with your grapple move.  More like WWF Wrestlemania 2000 or No Mercy, this game undos that---you cannot break up grapple moves in progress at all in this game.  Even breaking up pins or submissions is a sloppy affair which may or may not even work.

I played and owned WWE Smackdown vs Raw 2007, and thought it was great.  2008 takes away a great concept... stamina recharge.  In 2007, you could press and hold a button to regenerate stamina after some brutal bouting.  In 2008, you don't; you just have to stand around doing nothing to build it back up, just like in DOR2.

The struggle submission system is just an absolute mess.  About the only ""struggle"" in this submission system is the struggle of smashing the control stick with your palm to get it to break you loose.  Because they've only just substituted button-mashing A with button-mashing the control stick side to side.  Even then it appears to be a crapshoot as to whether I'll break out of a submission hold early.  I can't even see or have control over submitting!  Whereas in previous games, a bar would show you how close you are to submitting, in this game it doesn't tell you jack, just leaving you to smash the stick around and pray you don't randomly submit.

I don't know when this started in the Smackdown vs Raw franchise, but having been a veteran of WWF Wrestlemania 2000 all the way to WWE Day of Reckoning 2, it came as an utter shock in SvR07, and continued in SvR08, of pretty pathetic sexism on the WWE's part, as women are not allowed to wrestle in ANY match that isn't a normal, iron man, or submission match.  That means no women flying off the top of steel cages, no women prying the Women's championship belt from the top of a ladder, no women backstage in the parking lot.

Argue all you want that the WWE doesn't show that anyway, but they HAVE had it happen before, AND they've let women wrestlers do it as recently as 2005 in WWE Day of Reckoning 2!

Rather unlike DoR and DoR2, the certain chain-wrestling feel of the game is completely eliminated here in favor of stilted action featuring strikes and grapples, unable to be interrupted, save for with generic reversals and counters which could not for the life of them pass off as chain-wrestling.  It's clearly a brawler/powerhouse's game, as the advantages of a technical or submission wrestler or high flyer are pretty much nonexistant---a higher level high flyer or technical wrestler of equal skill to a lower level powerhouse or brawler will always lose, because the ""pretty"" moves are nowhere near as effective as the ""effective"" moves.

AND IN FACT!  That is EXACTLY what it does!  Playing the game on Xbox Live is utter hell, as the vast majority of players are the kind who soup up their custom characters to level 100, give them generic names like ""KILLA"" or ""DX DEMON"" or ""THUG FACE MUGGER"" in ALL CAPS, either being the most boring generic John Cena lookalikes or obnoxiously dressed like the Insane Clown Posse in neon green hoodies.  And virtually all the players are brawler or hardcore slash powerhouses---because being a Powerhouse gives you the ability ""rampage"" which makes all your grapples unreversable and makes you auto-rever all grapples done to you.

You can see the destruction begin just with that...

Unless you play with friends, or manage to find the one rarity that plays at your level, or bothers to actually WRESTLE, you'll pretty much be outright fighting---not wrestling.  It seems every random asshole mentioned above will fill their movelist solely with the easiest to use spears, big boots, running STOs, and other hard and generic slams, and will immediately rush at you to do a running spear or running STO, and proceed to do nothing but these moves directly on you until they fill their momentum bar, use Rampage ability, continue to do the same, and pin you.  The absolute worst of these will do nothing but their running grapples---spears or running STO's.

This pretty much renders online wrestling impossible.  You'll just be online fighting.

In SvR07, I was blown away by not only the variety but the creativity in choice of legends.  You can unlock perennial favorites like Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, and Mick Foley, but you can also unlock all three of Foley's faces (Cactus Jack, Mankind, Dude Love), The American Dream Dusty Rhodes, Eddie Guerrero, Hulk Hogan, Bam Bam Bigelow, Jerry Lawler, Jim Neidhart, Roddy Piper, Taz, Bret Hart, Mr. Perfect, etcetera.  THAT is one hell of an impressive legends roster, and big enough to fill WWECW's roster on Sci-Fi!  Imagine re-enacting the classic bouts between Bam Bam Bigelow and Taz from Living Dangerously 98 and Heatwave 98!

In SvR08, the legends roster is back to status quo: Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, Mick Foley, Roddy Piper, Bret Hart.  The only fun new additions are Rick Rude and Terry Funk.

As for the roster, it's actually more accurate in reflecting the WWE's roster at the time of its release---razor thin.

SvR07 had a far wider variety and size in its roster, including several superstars who remained and remain contracted to the WWE and on WWE TV, but were apparently not good enough to fit in the already undersized WWE SvR08 roster.

The roster is missing: Jillian Hall, the Boogeyman, Lance Cade, Trevor Murdoch, Paul London, Brian Kendrick, Hardcore Holly, Super Crazy, Shelton Benjamin, Charlie Haas, Kevin Thorn, Nunzio (Little Guido), Viscera (Big Daddy V), Matt Striker, The Miz (thank god), John Morrison (note, he's actually in the game, but still as Johnny Nitro), Balls Mahoney, Deuce and Domino, etcetera.

The roster includes: Chris Masters, The Sandman, Sabu, and King Booker.  These four were released well before the game was released, and considering how they rushed to remove all traces of Chris Benoit from the game, they probably kept these four in to keep the roster from being COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY BORING!  How much fun can you have with Kennedy Kennedy and Elijah Burke vs Snitsky and Chavo Guerrero compared to Paul London and Brian Kendrick vs Shelton Benjamin and Balls Mahoney?

Almost the most insulting of all is the score level.  As I mentioned above, you can train your character up to be 100, and the WWE Superstars have preset scores.  These numbers represent their skills in strength, speed, hardcore, charisma, stamina, durability, technical prowess, and submission.

Like many people who played this game, I have to say that it's a pretty huge disappointment.  I ignored the relatively poor rating on Amazon and assumed that people were just being cranky about the new combat system.  I played through about 90 % of this and kept hoping for a big payoff at some point.  I finally realized that there wasn't going to be one and that I'd just wasted 30 hours of my life.  The entire game you spend running down tunnels with different wallpaper fighting incredibly monotonous battles over and over again, then watching really lame cut scenes (the characters in this FF are completely lame with impossibly to decipher motivations for what they are doing).  Especially early on, the battles are always painfully easy, but you have to fight or your characters aren't going to get enough experience and will end up underpowered (in this FF you can actually see the bad guys and can skip some of them if you want).  I don't really mind the new combat system, but it basically requires you to do nothing more than hit X a few times over and over again (unless you are fighting a boss), which makes it really boring.  There are very few city or hub areas, basically no exploration, and very little NPC interaction, which really takes all the character and flavor out of the game.  It's really more of an interactive movie than a game--but a really bad one, with boring characters with nonsensical motivations, and a story that at 90 % of the way through still seems like nonsense.

 I realize you could say that some of these criticisms apply to all Final Fantasy games (linearity, boring fights), but I liked the other FF games I played (7 and 10).  For example, the ones I've played are also very linear even though they give the illusion of freedom (even the illusion is almost entirely absent here.) Somehow though, the linearity and the monotony of the fighting here is so much worse than ever before.

 Before I leave I want to address the whole ""well it really hits its stride about 20 hours in"" thing that I always hear.  First of all, a game that takes 20 hours to hit its stride is a horrible game.  It is true that about 20 hours in (roughly 2/3rs of the way through the game I'd guess), you reach a wide open area that you are actually allowed to explore and given some freedom of movement. The only things you can do here are 1) Fight challenges against various boss type enemies (I think you win rewards) and 2) Pick up item orbs and buried treasure--I think it's possible to use a Chocobo to look for buried treasure and to reach some otherwise inaccessible treasure orbs.  I explored a fair amount, but never messed around with the Chocobos and only did a few of the challenges.  There are no NPCs (I mean literally 0 anywhere) or really anything that interesting in this area, except that, like the rest of the game, it's very nice looking.  In order to advance the plot, you have to leave this area and go back to trudging down tunnels fighting stuff.

You might even say that the part of the game everyone says ""makes the game better"" is optional, except that you probably need to explore and mess around there for a while to level your characters high enough to comfortably continue.  Clearly, this is not enough to somehow make an awful game good.

Obviously it looks amazing, but that's about all it has going for it.

Gameplay tip (since I always give one in reviews):
- You can't actually level up until a few hours into the game (it will be obvious when).  So until you reach that point, just run by as many enemies as you can because there is no reason at all to fight them.

Edit: I have decided that 1 star is too harsh considering that this is a playable, bug free game.  So I'm moving it up to two stars.  But my opinion of it hasn't changed at all.","Awful, avoid at all costs",1305849600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
2.0,False,"12 6, 2004",A1UL2JH7XOUGM5,B0002X7Y2C,Ruined,"Half Life 2 could have been an all around excellent game.  Unfortunately its flaws bring it down into the levels of mediocrity for many players.

First off, let's start with the bugs in this game.  No matter what brand processor, motherboard, videocard, or soundcard you have, no matter how fast your system is, there is a very good chance you will suffer from crashes, sound stuttering, and frequent 5-10 second freezes in this game.  There are many things Valve will tell you is wrong with your system that is causing the problem, but in the end it is a problem with their programming of the source engine - which has some unforseen compatibility problems with a wide spectrum of hardware.  Valve has still not delivered a satisfactory patch addressing the bugs in the game.

Next up is inefficient shader programming.  Though the game runs beautifully on modern Nvidia GeForce 6600/6800 videocards, at max detail, buyers with older cards are not so lucky.  If you have a GeForce FX 5200/5600/5900 card, you will be forced into using a lower quality DirectX 8.1 mode even though the GeForce FX supports DirectX 9.0.  This is because Valve coded the shaders inefficiently, and failed to use partial precision (FP16) in their game unlike all the other DirectX9 games available.  By using a mixed precision path, which Valve stated would be in the game and benchmarked over a year ago, they could have made DirectX9 available to owners of older GeForce FX cards.  However, much like the rest of the game, the graphic implementation here appears rushed, and again we have less than desirable results for a large amount of people.  So don't expect anything approaching the best quality unless you have the latest $300 videocard.

But the disappointment does not end there.  Most games you type in your CDKEY, hit install, wait a 10 minutes, and you are done.  Not Half Life 2.  After doing the initial standard 10 minute cdkey/install, you then have to install a program called steam on your hard drive and setup an online account.  This takes another 10 minutes.  After you have setup the steam account, you then have to wait for the files to be decrypted on your hard drive.  This takes about 30-45 minutes for the games on the CE.  So now you are talking an hour+ just to install the game.  You think, boy, after all that, it must be real easy to play, right?  No way.  You have to keep the CD in the drive like any other game, and on top of that you have to launch the steam program, wait for it to connect to the internet, then you can play Half Life 2 - every time you play the game.  There is a hassle you can go through to play HL2 offline, but you still have to install, activate, and decrypt the files on steam at least once.  Major, major, major intrusive pain in the rear that no buyer of a retail CD should have to endure.  This is a case where anti-piracy measures have hurt the consumer more than the pirates.

If you are not fed up with the game after the long and intrusive install, the missed opportunity in terms of graphic performance, and the bugs that may bring your game to a grinding halt on a frequent basis, then you may actually enjoy this game.  But that's a *big* if.

Proceed with caution with this title.  What could have been a great gaming experience has been marred by sloppy general programming & bugs, inefficient graphics programming for older graphics cards, and a horribly intrusive and painful install procedure that persists past the install and into your gameplaying experience.  If you think you can deal with these issues, this is definitely a cool game.

This is by far the worst Halo in the series.  The storyline is terribly broken, which switches characters and missions constantly, leaving you without a hint of immersion.  I had no idea what I was doing until 3 hours in the campaign, only to be switched to another persons perspective.

The big sell point of this game was also of course, the firefight mode.  I have yet to get more than one person in a game for this mode since xbox live friends are more for show than to actually play with.  I understand the novelty of getting your buddies to link up their xboxes to play halo, but that was 5 years ago.  It's time to open up coop gaming to random people.

Like so many of Razer's products there is a colorful glow emanating from the devices that I think is really cool (and drives my wife nuts). If the device worked as advertised it would be a 5-star for sure. The mouse is extremely light because it doesn't need to have the battery onboard to work wirelessly. And it is incredibly responsive and sensitive to even slight movements; I can't discern any lag between moving my hand and the on-screen movement. This makes it optimal not only for gaming but also for productivity. So it could function as an all-purpose mouse, not just gaming.

The mouse has multiple configurable buttons, and the colors are advertised as configurable as well. However, after an hour+ and multiple install-uninstall efforts, all with the guidance of customer support I could not get the Razer software to recognize the device at all on my Mac. Based on my interaction in the Razer forum, Mac is just not well supported, usually involving a lot of bugs and a long delay in supporting any operating system upgrade.

I really like the bass and it's booming power, but the clarity isn't very good. Sound feels flat and lacks dimension and cohesion. These might as well have been earbuds.

I like the design. It is flexible and can be shaped into any mold. Sound recording is sufficient, but not good enough for basic video voice overs.

So I finally got Gamefly so I can save some money on games. I figured I would try Silent Hill Homecoming... mistake.

You can invert the gun aim, but not the camera. That doesn't make any sense at all. I always invert my controls, so this game sucks for me, as the camera doesn't go where I want it to go and the game won't allow me to make it work right.

The question is this: why would they let you invert the gun aim but not the camera? Do they honestly think that players would want to switch their control scheme entirely for looking when shooting and looking when walking around? A little continuity would be nice here.

Inverting the look is natural to me... pressing the control stick up is like leaning your head down (looking down), whereas pressing it down is like leaning your head back (looking up), so not being able to make the controller work that way makes the game frustrating and unplayable. I tried to play the thing with the non-inverted camera and it is just completely foreign to me, like writing left-handed. I can do it, but it is not natural and I am very slow at it.

So, I hopped on Destiny to play the campaign on day one, since my friends didn't invite me the first time of go, I went on the Destiny subreddit and found a cool/chill guy to beat the campaign. We played about 3 - 4 hours a day for 3 or 4 days maybe 5 (I don't know) straight, just the two of us. Once we completed the campaign we said, ""WTF, thats it?,"" ""All we got was a GUN?!?.""

That is what is heard through households that own an XBOX but for some reason or another they are still in the 90's and don't already have a DVD player.

Like my title suggests, if you already have a DVD player, this is a waste of money. The only reason I purchased one is because my DVD player had problems playing some DVD-R's that I got from a friend. I had some money to burn so I just wanted to see if the XBOX DVD kit could play it to determine if the DVD was a bad burn or was it just my DVD player. I found that the XBOX was able to play the DVD-R's in question with no problem. However, aside from those two DVD-R's, all of the DVD's I own are bought from retail stores, so I really have no need to play DVD-R's, and my DVD player plays normal discs perfectly.

With that being said, I only used XBOX's DVD playback kit once to watch the DVD-R's I had problems with. Because of the content of these burned ""movies"", there is really no need to watch them again....... However if push comes to shove I can always use one of my PC's or Mac to watch the burned DVD; no need to use my XBOX for that. I meant to return the DVD kit the next day, but never got around to it.

Moreover, I want to prove to myself that ME3's ending, as disappointing as it is, cannot mar the eternal beauty of ME1 (and to a lesser effect, also ME2) - And I am happy to report that I was not disappointed.

To begin with, it is crucial to establish that ME1 is unique in the series because it is a RPG with shooter element, whereas ME2 and ME3 are shooters with RPG elements. The most important and simple distinction is this: In ME1, regardless of how well your aiming skill is, your weapons' accuracy is, by and large, dependent on the XP you invested in a particular weapon. On the other hand, in ME2 and 3, your aiming skill (along with reaction speed) determines your accuracy. In this regard, to me, ME1 is the best in the series as a RPG; with ME3 being the best as a shooter(in spite of its disappointing ending; and ME2 somewhere in between (for the overall games in disregard of the genres, I'd rate ME1 being the best game overall, followed by ME2, then ME3).

Also, ME1 leans heavily toward exploration. Granted, this is the least developed aspects of the game, especially in regard to driving around the planets in the M35 Mako infantry assault vehicle or running around the Citadel doing side quests, which can be uneventful for the most part - if not downright boring. On the other hand, running or driving around afford you some spectacular views such as the Earth rise from the moon or awe-inspiring vista from the Citadel docking bay.

In addition to the reasons above, the primary reason that ME1 is special to me is its story elements. As a former fan of the 80s science fiction mini-series like Battlestar Galactica (the one and the only original one, of course) or Buck Roger, I have to say that ME1 captured the atmosphere and the mood of these mini-series perfectly - and even better in many cases. As is, obviously having drawn many experiences from their excellent previous work in the Knight of the Old Republic, the EAbioware writing team, headed by Drew Kapyshyn, did a stellar job in creating their own science fiction universe and its own saga.

The music in ME1, composed by Jack Wall and Sam Hulick, may not be perfect - but it is a perfect fit for the game. Surely, it is not as melodramatic as the music in ME3; nor is it as inspiring as ME2's. However, when framed within of the aforementioned science fiction genre, it is simply perfect. As is, I also have the soundtrack of ME1 and highly recommend it fellow ME fans.

Another remarkable achievement for ME1 - at least for me - is that up until ME1, I never really give a damn about voice acting in games. In fact, I strongly dislike the idea of merging video games and movies together - and I still do. However, ME1 is an exception due the outstanding performances by virtually all the actors involved - especially Jennifer Hale, who voiced the female Commander Sheppard.

In conclusion, and also in retrospection, in spite of all the little things that ME1 did not get right, in addition to the overreaching but worthless limited activation DRM scheme that wrecked the overall product (a serious offense in my book which results in an unfortunate deduction of 2 stars for the product), the game itself is beautifully executed and its story is a substantial work of well-implemented science fiction. Therefore, whether you are newcomer to the ME series or a veteran - and if you think the DRM scheme is worth the trouble - taking into considering the game's dirt cheap current pricing - it's worth it to embrace the eternity of Mass Effect 1.","""Embrace Eternity"" (at EAbioware's Discretion)",1345939200,,{'Format:': ' DVD-ROM'},

These includes for the Americans M3 Grant (medium tank) and M3 GMC (tank destroyer/mobile artillery), for the British the Mosquito (bomber) and the 25pdr (stationary AT gun), for the Italians the M11-39 Carro Armato (medium tank), and for the Germans the Sturmgeschutz (tank destroyer),PAK75 (stationary AT gun), and the BF 110 (fighter/bomber).

At first glance EA's Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects might not seem like that type of game, but make no mistake that it is: a repetitive and quickly boring beat 'em up with a host of technical issues.  You can play as a variety of Marvel Comics heroes and villains, as well as six ""Imperfects"": cyborg-esque warriors created specifically for the game.  The single player mode is ungodly repetitive as you battle hordes of generically created enemies.  This gets boring real quick, with button mashing galore and repetitive gameplay.  The destructable environments seem like a good plus at first, but you'll soon learn how much they actually work against you in a brawl, and it becomes more frustrating than it should be.  The cumbersome control scheme adds to this, not to mention that the controls can get to be quite buggy as well.

For the full MSRP I cannot suggest even a die hard fan of Left 4 Dead to purchase this, more out of principal than anything else. For $35 though (The amount I paid on Black Friday), the purchase can be justified for if you look at this game as DLC (Downloadable Content) the magnitude would certainly reach $35 as DLC... Certainly not $60 though.

That said... I can't rate the game too high as it is essentially the same thing and nothing more than a rip off. At the $35 price it maybe could have a 3 star rating but even then it doesn't feel deserved as GTA IV's DLC seemed to offer much more to the game and would maybe even be better classified as a sequel than L4D2 will ever.

No less, I stick with the 2 star rating across the board due to the fact that the best aspect of this game would be co-op but sadly is not. Playing online is fine and dandy but the real fun in playing any game is when you can do so with friends in the same living room. With L4D2, as with the first, you can only ever play two players in the same living room with a split screen. I cannot understand for the life of me why they would not allow all four characters to be played on a split screen. This inability, or laziness from the developers, is what ruined much of the replay value of L4D and the same here. It is absolutely inexcusable as to why four players cannot play together on a split screen.

Additionally, I must rate this low due to the fact you are paying a standard premium for sub-par packaging. The case the game comes in is thiner and lighter than most normal games (I noticed this at the store before purchased but assumed it was due to a cheap, flimsy 3-4 page manual... Surprisingly, the manual was in color which is one of the high points of this game). Back to the case... The case has cut-outs. Several sections of the case is cut out leaving the game itself entirely vulnerable to outside forces. If you removed the paper from the DVD sleeve the disc would be exposed the outside.

Valve, or their manufacturing company, claims environmental reasoning's for this cheap product. Now, I don't buy into the global warming hoax. There is no hard scientific evidence that the globe is warming or that human activity is contributing to any change in weather. For those in doubt please read the recently leaked emails. Moreover, Carbon Dioxide is not a pollutant nor harmful to the environment or human health. We as humans exhale carbon dioxide, they are going to tell us that the gas we exhale is dangerous to our own health? Hogwash. What's next: Swallowing your own spit causes throat cancer? Where does this nonsense end? CO2 actually helps plants grow more lush and full, it is more beneficial to the environment than not.

I digress... Regardless of how one feels about global warming as consumers we ought be outraged as the company is saving money by cutting out plastic and cheapening their products while not passing on the savings to us which means they are making extra profits and are assuming that environmental concerns will leave us consumers ignorant to their ploy of increasing profits while delivering an inferior product. If they wanna cut out plastic and cheapen their product, fine. It's not for the environment but for their profits and if for profits, and even for the environment, those savings most certainly should be extended to the consumer.

This yet another case of a major corporation using the global warming hysteria to cheat consumers and turn extra profits based on public ignorance. Don't buy into it as a consumer for if the savings aren't passed along to us it is nothing but devious. Same with T-Mobile wanting to charge their customers $1.50 every month for receiving their bill in the mail as opposed to only on their website.

Unfortunately, the low-resolution and sub-par framerate of this camera have left a bad taste in my mouth.

Video chats are not that impressive because of the low framerate of the camera. Instead of 30 frames per second, like most digital cameras, I think the Vision camera has a framerate of maybe 10-15 frames per second. And that's on a good day. If you and a friend are chatting and just sitting still, this will offer decent results. The second one of you start to move, the video becomes choppy and grainy almost instantly.

Speaking of grain, the resolution of the Vision camera rivals that of most entry-level cell phones. I understand that it would be extremely cost prohibitive to include a 5 megapixel camera, but taking a picture with this thing is just bad. Unless you have professional-grade lighting equipment in your house, you're not going to get anything that's worth keeping for too long.

Another thing that was promised with the use of the Vision camera, was gesture-based and live feed based gaming. The game that comes for free with the camera, Totem Ball, has been a continual source of frustration because the camera has a hard time picking up where you're standing and where your arms are at. To move your character around and ultimately play the game, you have to continually move your arms up and down. It would be one thing if this was just physically tiring, but the game is really not that good and the camera has a hard time distinguishing where you are or how far away you are if you're playing on a larger TV set. And the live feed based games just show a continual video feed of your usually semi-nude opponents during games like UNO and a few others. This doesn't offer that much to the gameplay except you now get to see who's calling you racial slurs or hurling homophobic remarks.

PROS:

-Graphics are truthfully on the level of Assassin's Creed. Need I say more?

-Gameplay was one of the better features, but it was still a pretty simple and dumbed down hack n slash game. True you can dismember enemies, but that offers little more than graphic pleasure. It would have been much more entertaining if maybe you could disarm enemies or even cut an arm off and have them keep fighting. I thought the bosses were pretty easy as well; all you have to do really is dodge and wait for a certain button to pop up and press it.

In truth, all you have to do to defeat the majority of enemies is mash one or two buttons again and again till they go down. Also, whenever your attacks land you gain energy for your charge attacks, which reminded me of the musou attacks from Dynasty Warriors.

-Looting is fine but nothing out of the ordinary. All you have to do is run over items that your enemies drop, like health potions, to obtain the. Except for chests, then you have to either hold or tap a button.

CONS:
- The story is about a resurrected Viking who goes on a campaign to seek vengeance and reclaim his homeland from an evil Greek Goddess. Sound a little like God of War? Also, the main character doesn't say one word and so you get no character development. There are also no plot twists, notable supporting characters, factions. Nada.

-One of the things that I was super disappointed with is that you can never upgrade nor change your weapons. Your three main weapons are your sword, axe, and throwing axes. Also, there is no armor or repairing in the game.

-The only thing you can really do with the money you earn is buy health items or new combos (which don't really change the game all that much).

-You can't customize your character at all. No clothes, haircuts, or tattoos - nothing.

-You're always on foot. It would have been nice if you could have had the option to buy a horse or have been able to ride your dragons so you don't have to walk everywhere all the time.

-The missions themselves are very repetitive and lack variety. You rescue other Vikings, kill some traitor, or kill a group of enemies to clear a location.

-The enemies themselves aren't anything special either, there are about eight different types of enemies and each class of unit all look exactly the same as the next. The enemies you typically encounter don't have much to distinguish themselves as far as difficulty other than the fact that they have a shield or you have to hit them more times before they finally go down.

-What most critics are saying that is so great about this game is the huge battles. In reality, there are only 3 or 4 of them and if you try to fight the whole army you'll die over and over again. The point is to take out the groups of sorcerers to stop the spawning of new troops. So, it's really a trick to make you think it's going to be awesome when really it's like Dynasty Warriors in the sense that all you have is take out the leaders and you win automatically.

Specifically, all you have to do is rush towards and kill the sorcerers manually or use your tokens to get your dragon to kill them for you. You get these tokens for doing things like killing all the archers or killing a giant.

Also, the objectives for these big battles never change; the only thing that separates each battle from the next is the scenario and landscape.

Not only that, the amount of ammunition it takes to put down a run-of-the-mill peon is near improbable.....two to three shots up close with a shotgun?!  I don't think so.
The camera angles are atrocious!  When you have to fight several enemies you have to maneuver your character all around the room (basically running around) to find other guys to battle.  And when you fight them you sometimes cannot even see them until they are in the midst of throwing a blow...that's not cool.
Usage of slow motion (a-la Max Payne, a superior title to this one) is helpful and pretty darn cool - you can throw explosive canisters and shoot them, causing an explosion around your enemies, plus you can avoid other bullets that way, as well.  Max Payne seems to be much better at this, though.

I had rumble off, volume off, power saving on, and brightness was set to 1. For $11 (it was on sale in November 2013 here), I'd say it was well worth it. The minor irritation is that it adds a little weight to the gamepad which takes time to adjust to. The sale is over on Amazon but still ongoing via GameStop.com, although you'd also have to pay shipping.

The official competitor is the Nintendo high-capacity battery for $32.

The entire game is nothing more than a series of hallways filled every few steps with chest high walls and cover based shooting.  There's no variation or free roaming that the original had.  There's a few hard to find (unless you look them up online) side missions that you must do if you want enough money to buy all the upgrades.  The main missions are predictable and boring.  Except for the New Horizons mission and the final mission, you spend the entire game collecting new shipmates and doing their loyalty missions.

The team mates and their missions are lackluster at best and downright awful at worst.  Never mind most of your team mates are useless in combat even when micromanaging them using manual power controls and giving them cover / firing orders.  See, the new system gives them few abilities and most of them are situational.  Since at higher difficulty levels every enemy has armour, shields, and/or barriers, if you don't have the correct counter ability to strip them, your team mates need them.  That means, Samara, Mordin, Thane, or Miranda. Unless you are doing a loyalty mission, you will play with one of those four.  You NEED them, unlike say Tali who doesn't even have Overload to take out shields.

Then there's resource gathering.  Its terrible.  You don't have to scan every planet, but you should find a guide like Mass Effect wiki to find out what planets have ezero or high concentrations of what you need to upgrade instead of randomly searching every system.

The cover based shooting system is terrible.  Your guns do little to no damage until you've stripped the shields/armour/barriers off and everyone has at least one and many have two or more.  You need team mates that have counter abilities like warp for barriers, overload for shields, and incinerate for armour.  In addition you should get the ammo power for yourself that fits this as well.  Incinerate ammo, warp ammo, disrupter ammo.  However, this is a small help and you really need team mates in your party with the primary three abilities. This is key because you have limited ammo and some levels are scarce with ammo drops (like when everyone is on ledges and you can't get to their ammo drop).  To avoid running out of ammo in your guns, you use the three powers to take out enemy protections allowing your guns to kill them.  So if your team mate doesn't have one of these three abilities, they just sit around waiting for you to strip the protections off as their guns impotently struggle to damage foes.

Frankly, the desire to clone Army of Two or Gears of War leaves me cold.  The simplistic combat system of hiding behind walls every single second is stale and done better in other games.

Okada,"In what was arguably the weakest pre-order premium, Amazon gave away CTA brand screen protectors, or rather redemption codes for use with future orders. Why they didn't just ship them with the PSVs I can only guess is because CTA didn't have them ready at the time.

When it did arrive, it was packaged in an unmarked zip lock bag and was bent at the corners, but not folded to the point where it was unusable. Unlike other PSV screen protectors, the CTA model only covers the actual display portion of the PSV. Not a major issue since it's the touch/visible portion of the console that people want to protect, but it doesn't blend in quite as well as full face protectors.

While the bends could be worked out, the adhesive side of the protector had some particles/dust on them, most on the edges, but one inside the edge that formed a decent bubble when the film was applied. This is the first time I've seen something like this after years of using screen protectors for GPS units, DS, iPhone, iPod, etc. By luck, the speck of dust or maybe plastic from when the sheets were cut at the factory was just on the border of the PSV display making it non visible when in use and with a fair amount of massaging the bubble was reduced to the point where the speck is barely visible. The 4 specks on the edges of the film can't be smoothed out since there's no way to form a vacuum seal on the edges leaving 4 spots on the edges where the film doesn't contact the display (""bubbles"").

The surface of the film itself is on par with most screen protectors; it shouldn't scratch and produces minimal to no optical distortion compared to a bare display.

Bad QC in general here. Given the number of PSV screen protectors that are available, I just don't see how anyone could recommend this one unless it was free.

Anyway, I was so pumped up for this game that I preordered it at GameStop and went to their midnight release for it. The demo wasn't that great, but I figured it was only the demo...

Well, after completing all 4 campaigns on normal difficulty, I can honestly say that I am sorely disappointed in RE6. Playing through this game felt like more of a chore then anything else. Leon's campaign was the only one that seemed like a RE game at all and was the most ""fun""...and I use that word lightly.

Forget the zombies, monsters and bosses in this game. The biggest killer you'll encounter in this game is THE CAMERA. That will kill you more times then any walking corpse could hope to do. Especially during the game's many running segments, where the camera angle will change suddenly and it takes a while for the character to catch up to it.

Which also brings up the point of the MANY cheap, unavoidable deaths. It felt like they were saying, ""Well, you have to die sometime so....BLAM!"" Unless you know what is coming there are many instances where you'll be playing, surrounded by enemies guns ablazing, and suddenly without warning you will get run over by an ambulance. Or there will be a sudden QTE that you will miss because it comes out of the middle of nowhere.

I am not opposed to QTE's but they are overly done in this game and done poorly at that. You better get your thumb loosened up because you'll spend half the game wiggling the thumbstick at a furious level.

The controls are just bad overall, including a horrendous new cover system. It seems that they went out of their way to overcomplicate everything. The inventory system is also a complete mess as well.

So, in closing I really wanted to love this game and I did beat it, but it felt like going to work. Jake's and Chris's campaigns were bad, Leon's was okay and Ada's I found just plain boring.

This makes the game series not only family friendly, but a blast to play regardless of your age.  Now the series makes it's debut on the DS, and while it still provides some of the fun found on the home console versions, something has noticibly been lost in translation.

I reluctantly accepted the removal of the keyboard instrument in hopes of getting a functional sequel to a long-running franchise that I really love.

This game actually has less songs than both Rock band 2 and Rock Band 3. This issue is compounded by the fact that many songs are niche, mediocre and all over the place in terms of genre (a lot of this is subjective, I know). Some songs stand out from the rest, and are fun to play, which is what's important. For me, the inclusion of Dream Theater's Metropolis Part 1 is what sold the game for me since it's one of my personal favorite songs of all time, but that is the hardest song in the game, meaning once I beat that, there's not much left for me to feel compelled to continue playing.

However, I will probably never be able to beat that song unless a massive update comes our way that fixes all the latency problems the new instruments have (for the record, the firmware updates do not fix all of the problems). Sure, I could whip out all my old instruments, but each of them have problems due to age, wear and tear, which is the main reason I ordered the Band-in-a-Box bundle in the first place.

The microphone works great in my experience, however, so if that is the part you enjoy most, you will likely enjoy the game more than others.

The game itself also has issues, especially due to Harmonix stripping the game of the extensive customization options that Rock Band 3 had. You also cannot access album info, view high scores per instrument, rate songs, filter your song list (this is a nightmare for those with lots of DLC), or create playlists in quickplay mode. Not all of the DLC available for RB3 is available yet for RB4. The character animations seem worse than previous games, and despite the game being 1080p and 60fps (the latter of which is a blessing and probably the one and only gameplay improvement that makes a difference in my opinion), the character and location designs seem less detailed than previous games, and the band members move around awkwardly while playing on stage.

If I had to guess, I would assume this game was rushed to release due to all of the problems and lack of features. Until it gets a massive update, I cannot recommend this game to anyone, especially fans of previous iterations in the series. If you have Rock Band 3, hold on to it and enjoy that until this game can get its act together.

Edit: The game works much better after several updates now, but now Harmonix is charging for features that existed in previous games. Ridiculous.",Stick with Rock Band 3,1447372800,4,"{'Edition:': ' Band-in-a-Box Bundle', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}",

Unfortunately, once I started I lost interest pretty quickly.  It is so similar to the earlier games that I felt I was just replaying one of the  other titles.
My biggest problem is that there have been few if any  upgrades to the basic game engine since #6.  Don't get me wrong, I like the  basic game engine.  The world looks interesting and is easy to navigate.  However, some of the problems that first bothered me in 6 have become even  more annoying in the later titles.  Namely:
HOARDS OF UNINTELLIGENT  MONSTERS: All monsters in the M&M universe behave in exactly the same  way.  Once they see you, they charge to attack.  (OK.  A few will shoot at  you from range, but the principle is still the same.) No opponents use even  rudimentary tactics. As a result, every fight feels the same.  And there  are A LOT of fights.  There are so many damn monsters in this game that  your finger will get sore from pressing the attack key, and the repetition  gets pretty mind numbing.  In particular, I got sick of the pirates on the  first island.  There's a trigger zone that creates new ones every time you  enter it.  How many times do we really want to kill the same monster  off?
MONSTERS DON'T REACT TO EVENTS AROUND THEM: The game uses the tired  D&D cliche of the dungeon crawl.  That is, you go into the first room,  kill everything there. Rest.  Move on to next room.  Repeat.  Guards in  other rooms don't react to your presence until you attack them, even if  that is months later.  Frankly, I would be happier if the next game in the  series used a system like the one in Fallout 2, where all the guards in a  complex react in a coordinated way to your presence once they realize that  you are there.  This forces you to use stealth, dialog skills, and to  really think about who you attack and when.
THE STORY IS STILL VERY  LINEAR: Basically, you have a bunch of quests you have to do.  You have no  real choices in who you ally yourself with and who you attack.  The world  consists of people you talk to and people you kill, with no overlap between  the two.
THE NPC SYSTEM COULD BE VASTLY IMPROVED:  You have no choice in  how you handle NPC's.  You hear what they have to say, then do their quests  for them.  I would much rather see the game move towards an NPC systme like  the one in Fallout 2, which is really quite good. Your lead character's INT  determines how many things he can think of to say, and his oratory skill  determines how well he can lie and manipulate people.  And you always seem  to have at least two or three different ways to approach any  NPC.
Overall, my big problem with this game is that there just isn't a  lot of thinking involved, or much freedom of action for the player.

It's been a strange ride for both FFXIII and the JRPG in general. Without summarizing the great past of the JRPG, however, it is safe to say that it has not found its niche in this generation, particularly on the PS3, where JRPGs have both been scarce and hard sells. That's not to say there haven't been solid titles (""Eternal Sonata,"" ""Tales of Vesperia,"" and ""Star Ocean have all been quite good), but the American RPG has just been significantly better, both critically and commercially.

But this was the one that would change all that, right? Well, not exactly.

Remember that FF XIII was supposed to be the title that would ""save"" the poor-performing PS3. Announced years ago as one of THE hot ticket exclusives, people would buy the system just to play this game. Or so the story went.

But some curious things happened along the way. First, the title was delayed again and again (for an extended period, Square wouldn't even hint at a release date). Then, in a shot heard round the fanboy world, Square announced that FF XIII would in fact be multi-platform. The Sony fanboys squealed, the X-box devotees delighted.

But the PS3 found its legs with cheaper (and better) models, and top-notch exclusives like ""Uncharted 2"". And finally, years after its announcement, FF XIII was released.

And so, we come to the biggest problem with the game: this feels like a launch title. If this had been released in 2007 or 2008, it might have made serious waves. I'm sure its graphical quality would have wowed the masses, and probably overcome its woefully boring gameplay. But it's 2010. No one is amazed by a pre-rendered fireworks scene, no matter HOW many times you show it (around 5, incidentally). We've seen ""Uncharted 2,"" and the fact is, these graphics don't improve on that game in the least. Heck, the movies hardly feel better than ""Metal Gear Solid 4,"" and that was released two years ago.

It's hard to point out anything exceptional about the game once you fail to be amazed by the graphics. The biggest praise has usually been handed out to the so-called Paradigm System, and indeed, there was much potential here. The problem is that the system is easy to master, and the game inexplicably introduces way too much chance into the proceedings. You can have a party with 5 paradigms that you really like, only to have the game mysteriously change your party around before a big battle. You have no chance to re-configure paradigms, so you're stuck with whatever you are given. Lame.

Battles come in two flavors: easy, and cheap. Since you can switch paradigms on the fly, and there is no MP measurement in the game, you can essentially use an attacking paradigm for every battle. When your party starts to get hurt - and this is key, people, so listen - you switch to a...healing paradigm! Then, when you are healed up, you switch back! <gasps!> People who claim a great strategy in this game have obviously never played a game requiring strategy.

This works for around 99% of the battles. But every now and then, you just get cheaped. As I mentioned above, sometimes the computer will randomly change the makeup of your party, and force you into a battle with a difficult foe (say, Bahamut). You are then required to react quickly enough to discern all of your new paradigms, and pick an appropriate one before he slaughters you, which happens after around two attacks. Of course, it would be simplistic if you could just have chosen your own paradigms, but that's not possible because of the random switch.

An even more egregious example is the ""stop"" spell bosses occasionally cast. During the battle with the final boss, ALL of my party members were hit with stop simultaneously. I had to sit and wait it out. The problem? I died before the spell ended. What a joke.

The item creation system is a joke. In order to get some items, you must first find another item, upgrade it, and then dismantle it. There is absolutely no rhyme or reason to which items you should do this for (e.g. I obtained the Sprint Shoes, which cast Haste on a character, from dismantling a Tetradic Tiara, which casts protect, veil...and pretty much everything else EXCEPT haste). What a joke. Upgrading is laughable. There are something like 100 components in the game, but they all do exactly the same thing: add experience to your weapon/accessory. Thus, a bomb core will do just was Murky Ooze does. Why even put all of these different components into the game? Oh right - to make it look like the developers actually did something.

The story of this game is pretty weak, and the character interactions are a laugh riot. Most of the game deals with a lot of existentialist hoo-hah about freedom of choice, even as it is clear that the characters dance on puppet strings for the entire game. The end of the game is just baffling, with a lame boss to boot. And the best part? Expect to hear such rich lines as, ""I wanted to tell the truth, but I was afraid people wouldn't like me!"" I think after-school specials were written better than this.

There's plenty of other things to rail on about (battles are too long, the game is too linear, with zero exploration, etc.), but I think I've made the point. It begs the question: why did Square need so long to develop this title? The graphics are nice, but they hardly wow, the gameplay is linear and the design is lazy. The sad part of it is that while this game will assuredly sell pretty well (the fact that it is the first FF title for this generation is more than enough to convince people to buy it), it will no doubt hurt the overall market for JRPGs. This is not a game to get excited about. This is a game that you buy and play only to convince yourself that you didn't waste $60.

The game's concept of being able to traverse a nearly infinite galaxy seamlessly is brilliant and practically unprecedented. The first time you explore an uncharted planet, fly out of the atmosphere into space, warp to another system, go through a black hole, see a bizarre space god, etc. is amazing. This is when the game truly shines. However, after about 20-25 hours of exploring, you realize you've seen nearly everything the game has to offer.  And you repeat these same things over and over in the exact same ways.

The practical gameplay of NMS is not only bare bones but very poorly done. Exploring is hindered by a terrible inventory system. Mining/crafting is hindered by constant need to refill or manage.  Ground combat is hindered by terribly simple yet finicky shooting. Space combat is hindered my poor maneuverability and no options other than your pew-pew cannon. Space exploration is hindered by a lack of variety in planets, aliens, etc. in a universe so vast.

Despite all the amazing scale and depth in a physical sense, the game is as shallow as budget titles from other indie titles priced at $20 or less.

This is not even mentioning the poor performance on both PS4 and especially PC.  I play on PS4 and the game crashes on me like crazy. I've had it crash no less than 20 times in the past 3 days. I've also warped into environments I shouldnt be able to and gotten stuck, forcing me to reset my game.

You get the sense that Hello Games bit off way more than they could chew and as ambitious and as beautiful as the experience is, it dwindles into monotony and frustration quickly.

I can only recommend this game once the glitches and performance issues have been ironed out, and when the price drops to $30 or less. Or perhaps if and when an update adds a substantial amount of content (which they should soon).","Great concept, horrible execution",1471219200,4,,

- Scenery, especially background scenery, is really nice
- Characters are good except for the Witch Doctor which makes no sense in a Gothic demon-hunting game
- There are some cool Achievements built into the game

Negatives:
- Game breaking bugs (DH + Templar shield combo breaks the game - i.e. you can't access your account anymore. No fix yet.)
- Requires an internet connection and the servers are constantly in some state of failure.

2.0,False,"03 15, 2014",A3PDYHA2GC9AW1,B00DB9JYFY,Bryan,"I'm a huge fan of the XB1, and I'm one of the outnumbered ones who is standing by this system over the PS4. I'm not taking a jab at the Xbox for the sake of trolling by giving this game a low score. I wanted Titanfall to be good, but it didn't have to be for me to enjoy my system. Unfortunately, it turns out that it actually is not very good. When your internet connection and the servers are working properly, it's a decent game, but the online limitation doesn't sit well with me, and the justification for making it online-only is completely bogus. Using the cloud to control AI didn't make the AI any noticeably better, and focusing solely on multiplayer didn't help improve anything about the multiplayer experience compared to the huge variety of excellent FPS games already on the market, many of which have offline play options.

Here's the main issue right out of the gate: the multiplayer experience offered by Titanfall has not improved over 2004's Halo 2 and most other top tier FPS games that have come out in the past 10 years. Honestly, hook up Halo 2 to an online LAN server via widely available software, and you can play it online to this day. Hook it up to another Xbox and you can do local matches without an internet connection. Alternatively, you could play single player. Without system link, LAN, or single player, Titanfall gives the player less. It's likely that Titanfall will never function properly without an internet connection, and the day the servers are shut off, the game won't be playable. In 2004, if your internet was terrible or lost service, you had options to play your games offline fully featured in every single game mode. In 2014: no internet, no game. We've seen this before from EA. Sim City was plagued by the same issue, and the justification was similar: they said they needed the online connection to control the citizen AI. That turned out to be a lie. They didn't need that at all. The online-only was done simply to combat piracy. Even so, the pirates cracked the game and were enjoying it offline. It was the paying customers who suffered. Titanfall is no different. You get the same basic game you got back in 2004, which is a good game, but you get no single player, you get no offline options, and you get nothing drastically new.

Titanfall features huge robots called titans which you call down to fight alongside you or to pilot manually. Having a titan fight by your side seems cool, but I've seen my titan stand there shooting the ground and other ridiculous things. When all is said and done, titans are nothing more than a glorified vehicle, no better than piloting a vehicle in any other FPS game. They aren't exciting and new. They're vehicles which can follow you around if you want. Imagine if your vehicle in Halo followed you around and shot at people while you weren't riding it: that's basically what it comes down to. It's not innovative enough to simply have titans in the game and just make everything else the same as usual. A deathmatch in Titanfall is still a deathmatch. A capture point game is still a capture point game. I mean, heck, every player gets a titan in every match, usually twice. In other FPS games at least you could fight for control of the various vehicles in a level. In Titanfall the only way to gain any advantage over anyone else is to try to lower the time you are waiting until the titan is ready by playing better than the other people, but getting your titan 15 seconds earlier isn't nearly as useful as simply stealing the level's only vehicle spawn in a different FPS game.

On that note, Titanfall really fails to give the skilled players much to set themselves apart in general. Not only do all players get the chance to have a titan on every level regardless of how they play, but there is an auto-aim homing bullet gun which does 1-2 hit kills, and its only drawback is that it takes a slightly longer time to fire it. This means that some guy aiming in your general vicinity might be able to kill you in a couple seconds without any sort of skill. The idea behind this is to level the playing field to make the game less daunting for people who stink at FPS games, but it's really counter to the spirit of playing one of these games. You'r supposed to have to aim and shoot at your opponent. Giving people the option to be lazy may cater to the new players, but it's not making the game a better game.

Along the same lines, the game will let people contribute to the team score by killing AI bots who run around the levels, and spawn in large numbers in various sections of the map. You'd think the AI would still be a fair challenge to kill, like fighting grunts and elites in Halo or something, but it's not like that at all. The AI bots are idiots who barely do more than stand there while you kill them. Farming the AI is exactly that: farming. It's not challenging or engaging in any way. Without any effort, I could mow down 5 of them at a time.

One neat thing is that Titanfall lets you run at high speeds at all times, and you can run along walls or jump from wall to wall. It's a fun mechanic, and it's simple to do, but it's hardly worth buying the game for. Limitations in mobility in other FPS games don't make those games any less strategic or fun. Sonic the Hedgehog runs faster than Mario and can run upside-down. Is Sonic more fun to play than Mario? It's just a different game with its own rules. There's nothing wrong with Titanfall's mechanics, but it's not worth buying the game for.

Along with these thoughts, I'm also rolling my eyes at the slow pace the developers have taken with making the game look next-gen. A bunch of cool effects don't change the fact that the game is launching at 792p, when most people expect next gen to run at 1080p. I can understand that launch titles weren't running at full specs due to time constraints and developers learning to use the new hardware, and the 60 frames per second is nice, but you're looking at a game which is supposed to really sell you on the next gen experience. Lighting effects are nice, but people want 1080p 60 frames per second before they want all the cool effects. It's sad to see the XB1's early system seller failing to at least meet that standard on time for launch.

All that being said, Titanfall is a game I could recommend to someone really itching for a online first person shooter, but for anyone else, stay away. If you're a casual gamer looking for a game to play on your new XB1, go for Dead Rising 3 or something with the ability to play by yourself without the internet. In 10 years, when the Titanfall servers are shut down, and you want to revisit your old XB1, you'll be a lot happier if you stick with games that don't require an internet connection.

2.0,False,"05 10, 2015",A2KEKPMI3WQMPA,B00GMFKYK8,pancake_repairman,"comparing this game to the latest bunch of action rpgs trailing the heels of dark souls 2 and bloodborne (lords of the fallen, dragon age: inquisition, bound by flame) this is the worst of the bunch. the assassins creed parkour and tower checkpoint systems are present in this game and the combat is also AC based with every encounter finding you surrounded by generally at least 10 enemies at a time, with multiple waves when you're fighting a boss. in this game though instead of a successful parry resulting in an instant kill it just knocks your opponent back dealing no damage. the difficulty is stacked so backwards. at the start of the game while you're trying to grasp the mechanics it will take you 8 hits to build up your hit streak to use an instant kill ability whereas later you'll be able to get two uses of the instant kill ability for every two swings of your sword.
most of the abilities you can unlock are basically useless. the execution (instant kill) and wraith stun (damaging aoe knockback) are the tier 1 abilities you'll find useful on the rare occasions you can manage to build your hit streak high enough to use them without taking a hit from one of swarm of enemies you're fighting and getting it reset.
the tier 2 ability critical strike will build your hit streak by 2 for each successful hit where you only press the attack button once (reward for not spamming) and shadow strike will enable you to teleport to a target which can be necessary for finishing a boss who has fleeing near death as one of their abilities. other annoying boss abilities include hate of defeat (if you get their health below 20% without instantly killing them it regens to 60%) and immunity to combat attacks (you will only be able to damage them with a bow or wraith stun) which makes boss difficulty completely randomized. their power ranking ultimately means nothing. if it increases their health or damage i didn't notice. a power level 20 boss can be easier to kill than a power level 3 boss depending on their abilities. any boss that has a ranged weapon (crossbow or poison throwing spears) instantly becomes more dangerous, being able to take off half your health at range if you aren't on them constantly. those with a shield are mid-tier since they're more aggressive and you can only counter their attacks with vault (X) not the parry (triangle) which you need to be ready to use for all other enemies. before you gain the vault stun ability they're virtually impossible. those with normal melee weapons are the easiest.
the tier 3 ability vault stun is the biggest power gain in the game. jumping over an enemy now stuns them so it's easier to build your hit streak being able to hit stunned targets after changing position to evade other enemies.
tier 4 gets you blade master (reduces the threshold of charging the hit-streak from a combo of 8 to a combo of 5) and finally tier 5 grants you critical strike 2 (landing a single press hit now increases your hit strike by 3, so combined with blade master you fill the gauge after two swings) and double charge (you now get two uses of your execution or wraith stun abilities for each time you fill the gauge).
the enemies don't seem to increase in power much throughout the game so it's just backwards difficulty. excessively frustrating at the start and then increasingly anticlimactic as you breeze through to the quicktime event final boss by repetitively setting up and completing battles to rank up your controlled uruks to warchief and eliminate the others. the slight amusement from the uruks' pre-battle dialogue and hunting trip with the dwarf does little to detract from the monotony. at least it's gameplay focussed with a minimum of hand-holding cut-scene story-progression content but the backward difficulty ruins the learning process of the gameplay. the learning curve is too steep at the start and gone almost completely by halfway where you're left monotonously setting up and completing the same battles to get the game over with.",headline for your review,1431216000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The image looks good but the distressed look isn't very realistic when you see it in person. I have no problems with the whammy bar or strum bar. My big (huge) gripe is with the buttons.

The buttons don't occupy the full width of the neck They're about 2/3ds of the width. What that means for me is that I often miss hitting a button  because I'm pushing the button on the side nearest to me.

The shape of the button is also a problem. It's squared of rather than rounded (like the Rockband 2 wireless guitar) so if you try to slide a finger from one fret button to another it can catch on the edge of a button.

I've been playing Rockband since it came out on XBOX 360 and also Rockband 2 and the Beatles edition. I'm decent and I can play most songs on Hard with no problem and some in Expert.

So I dug out my PS2 and desided to buy this game it looked really sweet to me. (Since I'm a huge fan of werewolves) Saddly I spent more time wanting to break the CD into bits then I enjoyed playing it.

(Please don't take me as a troll)

The game started out great I enjoyed the sonic day lvls it was fun to speed around and i got wicked good at drifting.  I did enjoy how it almost felt like sonic from 16bit days, but soon i started to have a lot of problems controlling Sonic.  He was more difficult to control then my car when i was learning how to drive!  He does go fast, boy does he go fast, but it's your first time playing so you die 10 thousand times cause you didn't know that you had to use homming attack to get over a broken part of the bridge or use light dash cause you're traviling at 130MPH. Oh ya and you only get 2 lives until you get enough sun and moon coins to open the doors, its the only way you can get more lives.  Here i am thinking its 100 rings like the old days ::sighs::

 The Were-Hog started off fun too he reminded me of a mix of Knuckles and Shadow the hedgehog(game) You kicked major butt and I enjoyed that for a while too ,but saddly like day sonic the were-hog ticked me off too.  He doesnt grab onto the items he's supose to all the time i hit R1 R1 R1 all the time and many a time he'd fall to his death, you make one ONE mere mistake and you're dead.  It's very frustrating and I've played ALOT of sonic the hedgehog in my time. (I'm 26)  Instead of making the were-hog fun they made him an acrobat who proforms without a net which is sad because he was fun to play and a bit easyer to control then day time sonic, but it seems Team Sonic also put in the camera angles from hell. A lot of the time i couldn't see how i was jumping and jumped into my own death along with small bits of land if you accidently make the were-hog run you easly fall off.  I honestly thing this game would of been better in 2D.

Thats why I'm sad about this game i really thought i would enjoy it but in the end i just want to return it and get my 18 bucks back (saddly i cant cause i opened it) It was a cool idea As i said i like werewolves ,but in the end i think im going to just put Sonic Heroes and Shadow the Hegehog back in my PS2 and try to unlock everything and let Sonic Unleased Rest In Peace.  Between all the terr-a-bad controls the lack of control with day time sonic, the frustrating levels with the were-hog, the borring as crap tutorals, Chip (enough said about him), The Hubs (which bored the crap out of me Sonic the Hedgehog is NOT about Hubs) The agervating as crap real time actions (reason why i stoped playing I died 10 times on the 2nd to last boss, the 6th temeple. It punishes you if you don't hit X fast enough and bad enough if you do die they change the buttons they could of atleast kept them the same so you could learn the pattern) Don't buy this game unless you enjoy a migrane it will just let you down you'll have fun for a bit then hit another level or area from hell that will slowly make you go were-hog on your game system.  This game is a far cry from the awesomeness that is sonic the hedgehog.

2.0,True,"05 22, 2016",A2YXQMZ32BY8XH,B00KO97D8E,IAMM3Z,"Underneath all the issues that plague Homefront The Revolution, there's a fun game just dying to be let out and played. Unfortunately, the issues that this game faces are so many and so often that what fun could be had is masked by an extremely poor frame rate, poor shooting,  and infinite loading screens that effectively end your current campaign forcing you to start over from the beginning.

I'm not normally one to complain too terribly much about a low frame rate so long as it stays at least somewhat consistent. Homefront The Revolution rarely, if ever, hit 30 frames per second, while consistently fluctuating between 15-27 FPS according to Digital Foundries analysis. This caused the game to be extremely disorienting for me. Even worse, when the game auto-saves, which is quite often, the game completely freezes for 3-4 seconds. It also occurs every single time you go into your gun locker to buy supplies or change load outs when you exit.

The shooting in this game is less than satisfying. It feels like a poor man's Far Cry purely in terms of shooting weapons. When you add in just how poor the frame rate is on top of the less than adequate shooting, then you have a game that just isn't that fun, especially when the core of the game is about shooting. The shooting mechanics can be adjusted to if not for the frame rate. The frame rate alone makes combat even more difficult than it already is.

The game is designed around Guerrilla Warfare. So the enemy AI is super aggressive and unforgiving. In the 1st two areas you visit, you will be extremely underpowered, and almost any attempt at engaging the enemy will result in your death. The game does well at making you feel like you really are in an oppressive society and really forces you to consider your attacks wisely. If you play this game like you might play a Far Cry game, then you're going to die a lot.

Despite it not being wise to run and gun around Philadelphia like you would in a Far Cry game, the games formula takes a lot of inspiration from that series. You have bases to unlock and a slew of side objectives scattered across the map. So this could be a positive or a negative, depending on if you like the Ubisoft style of open world game.

Another game that Homefront The Revolution takes inspiration from is Dying Light. The enemies, much like Volatiles in Dying Light will have a cone showing the direction they are facing when they are in search of you. The interiors of buildings resemble the same style as seen in Dying Light, and finding loot is almost exactly same in both games. Dying Light has much deeper crafting options, but Homefront The Revolution does resemble it slightly.

As a fan of both of those games, and despite very poor early reviews of the game before official release, I had hope for this game. I still believe when the game is patched to eliminate the crux of its issues, it will be worth a play through. But as it is now, I can't recommend this game at its current price given what a technical mess it is. Once Dambuster Studios patches the game up and it's around $20-25, it might be worth a pickup.

The biggest issue for this game surprisingly isn't its Ubisoft style of open world design, it's poor frame rate or its less than enjoyable shooting. The biggest issue is found around the 3rd district in the game. I won't spoil the story, but you're tasked with finding a certain NPC and photographing them. After this mission, many players, myself included, are unfortunate enough to find that our game has glitched out. It will require you to respawn, and when you press the respawn button, you will find yourself waiting indefinitely. Your only choice is to restart your campaign over again while hoping that you don't fall victim to the issue again, as this mission is part of the main story.

All in all, Homefront The Revolution is a game mired in technical issues, but a fun experience can be had underneath all of the problems that plague this game once it's patched and lowered in price.",A Poor Man's Far Cry Meets Dying Light,1463875200,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The initial phase of my life cycle with games is as follows. I want the game, I get the game. I decide if the game is awesome or not. If it is awesome, how long is its awesomness going to last. I really wanted this game so I wanted it to be awesome. After the honeymoon ended (24hrs later btw) I was disappointed.

2.0,True,"04 1, 2011",AA1D9EF5KV2GU,B003UF9E0O,Kenneth A. Weeks,"I was really looking forward to the release of Dragon Age 2 and after completing the game after 65 hours I was so disappointed. It seems like the game was rushed out the door with little concern on what they were putting out. Here are my observations of the game.

The game graphics look great but the play area has been greatly reduced to take place almost entirely in the city Kirkwall. Seeing the same areas over and over again just gets tiresome. And the recycling of the same area over and over again and just blocking off some areas with doors that don't open just plain lazy.

Combat was interesting with the acrobatic leaps and jumps performed by characters in combat but that's about as far as it goes on the good side. On things I didn't like was the fact that opponents explode like rotten fruit when killed. I didn't like the unending waves of enemies that pop out of the ground or literally drop from the sky usually next to your mage in the middle of combat.

Skills and inventory system, I liked the skills available in the skills tree but I don't like the fact that you have to click on each skill tree to see what skill are available and you can't do a side by side comparison to see what each one does. I didn't like the fact that some skills and spells are not available to all my mages forcing to take some mages who I just didn't want but couldn't take them because they couldn't heal.

The inventory system I just hated the fact that you can't change your companion's armor. Yes Isabella you do need a bath because you have to wear the same clothes for 10 years. I hated the category of junk that is literally just junk since when did a pair of torn trousers become treasure?

I really hated the conversation wheel more than once I found myself saying that is not what I wanted to say. Also it seemed like the choices I made in my conversation had absolutely no impact on anything that occurs down the road.

Which leads me to the romance options in the game, why give the option of flirting with someone and then they are not a romance option. It seemed the romance is not in-depth as it was in Dragon Age Origin. You have a couple of cut scenes and then that's it. I just hated the fact that you couldn't talk to your companions except at certain parts of the game. I also hated the fact that you couldn't get your companions together in one location and couldn't talk to them unless you went to their base location.

The quests which were a lot were a mixed bag of mostly go here and kill someone or get something. The plot was somewhat interesting but I had no choice in the matter. When I took up solidly for one group I still ended up fighting both groups to me it didn't matter what choices I made things were going to end the same. This means the game has absolutely no replay value if everything ends the same.

The entire game seemed like a complete failure and that the full intent of Bioware was to get something out the door no matter what and capitalize on the success of Dragon Age Origins. Looking at the system stats on the boxes tells the story Dragon Age Origins requires 20 MB HD space while Dragon Age 2 required 7 MB HD space, nearly 1/3 the size of Dragon Age Origins and it shows.","The King is Dead, Long Live The Jester?",1301616000,6,"{'Edition:': ' Signature', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

I was really interested and hoped it would be good.  I pre-ordered here at Amazon because of release day delivery and a gift card.  When I received the game and started playing I noticed a few things right away that were bad:

1.  Challenges are to easy.  Unlocked the achievements fairly quickly.
2.  The graphics are nowhere near as good as I thought they would be.  Was really looking forward to the art style and even the cut scenes are average.  And textures do not load right sometimes.
3.  The lag online is pretty bad at times.
4.  The campaign and multiplayer are the same (this is a good and bad thing)

The issue is I finished the campaign on hard without much challenge.  The choke points make it pretty easy.  For example I was playing a resistance campaign with a 15 minute time and all I had to do was stay on the turret to win.  Same place for 15 minutes and it was over.  The bot AI is pretty stupid.  I was hacking a point and they would not come over to the room.  I took all the enemies out twice and they still did not come in to help.  I died and by the time I had spawned and returned I had to reset and re-hack the whole thing.  This took a while so I spent a good 8-9 minutes doing this.  I have also noticed that the bots can have their back to you and do an instant 180 and kill with 1 shot.

To be fair this is an online team game in most respects.  Sure they have a campaign if you can call it that.  That is were this game is at least somewhat fun.  But completing the same objectives over and over gets old fast.  And some maps are very unbalanced.  The defending team will have a major advantage in some of these places, sometimes to a fault.

The customization is pretty good in terms of classes.  I do not care about the avatar dress-up part so I will not say anything about that.  As for the classes they seem pretty good.  With a few more good maps and a way to easily get a whole team into the same match this game could be a very fun game.  I really like how they let you change classes but not characters.  If you build your character as an engineer focused character then changing to a medic, operative, or soldier may cause you to lose some of those purchases abilities.  This means that a well balanced team would need to come in prepared with everyone playing their roll and sticking to a class for best effect.

Overall this game would be better had it been polished more.  I may come back and edit my review after a patch and some of that free dlc they talked about.  That could make this a much better game.  As it is I would say wait on this game unless you just have to have it.","Wow, really thought it would be better",1305849600,5,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I LOVE Uncharted. Drake's Deception is the greatest experience I've ever had while holding a controller, so if my review is biased, it's toward MORE stars. The action is solid and the controls are great. You'll find yourself using the path-tracing feature more than you think. The adventure, though not as sprawling as other games, is still compelling and varied enough to keep you interested. And the thrills are there, too. But not in high doses.

You'll be amazed at the graphics, make no mistake. There's no way to show how beautiful this game is unless you're looking directly at the Vita screen.

So where are the problems? The game developers decided to not only include all of the Vita's control options, but to make them mandatory. The first time you brush off a relic with the touchscreen, balance on a log, reassemble an inexplicably torn-up map, it's fine. But when it happens again and again and again and you're balancing on every log, you'll curse these developers for not seeing that these control schemes, though intended to make you feel like Drake himself, just draw attention to themselves and crack the experience. Then you gotta get settled back in.

The story is solid, but the writing is INCREDIBLY weak. Like, really bad. Luckily, when Sully arrives on the scene, it doesn't matter what they're saying. Just seeing them interact makes for a big smile.

And I fell in love with it.  Thief... then, the expanded version, ""Thief Gold,"" and then Thief 2... made for a truly AMAZING experience.  And, unlike most games, it was not a violent, mindless game... quite the opposite.
Well... I bought this game a couple of days ago.  I tried installing it on my main computer, running Win98SE (which runs 100% of every other program I've ever owned or tested).  Guess what?  Thief 3 is the FIRST GAME I'VE EVER TRIED which does not run except under WinXP.
Supposedly, it runs with Win2K or WinXP.  So, having 2K at work, I took it in and gave it a shot.  No go... even though this is, allegedly, ""supported.""  Why not?  Now, bear in mind that this is a high-end professional workstation, not an old machine and not a ""kiddie computer.""  But... it doesn't have the right ""pixel shader"" revision built in.

They removed one of the most commonly-used elements of the original game... the rope-arrows.  They have such simple level design that there aren't really any multi-level structures!

First off, the game is a button masher without any rhyme or reason as to which buttons execute what powers; not smooth and controlled like in X-MEN LEGENDS/MARVEL ULTIMATE ALLIANCE/JUSTICE LEAGUE HEROES games. It felt like I was going to break my controller! And it seemed as though the uptake was really slow, you know you press the punch/attack button and there seemed to be a slight delay, so you end up pressing buttons in an absolute frenzy trying to get the characters to respond quicker. Very frustrating!

The other problem is the game's camera, which likes to zoom in on irrelevant things for no reason at all. Also, some areas are really dark and there are small cracks that you can fall through, maybe this is a bug in the game, but not good.

Raven Squad: Operation Hidden Dagger takes place several decades in the future, after a global financial incident has crippled many of the world's foreign, third-world countries. Because of this, guerilla factions are warring between one another, claiming territories of their own through terrorism and violence. This is what the game centers around--an event that, supposedly, should lead the player into an exciting first-person shooter.

To put it simply, I wasn't paying much attention to the story. The voice acting, the lack of a clearer, more defined visualization of what was happening (i.e, the loading screen,) and the cut scenes do nothing to enhance the story. The graphics, while not bad, look like something that could have come out of a final run of Xbox, Gamecube of Playstation 2 games. You should expect more when loading up a 360 games graphics-wise when they're so far ahead with their technology.

The combat, in a nutshell, varies between the levels and how you have to complete the mission. The first `tutorial' level takes place primarily in first-person mode, but soon switches over to the tactical, RTS-styled gameplay halfway through the level. First-person mode leaves nothing to be desired due to the fact that the game has so many flaws. Your team's A.I is so stupid that, at times, they won't even shoot enemies that are coming by them, nor will they attempt to take cover unless you yourself are near it. They follow you around like dogs and expect you to take care of them most of the time. The same problem happens in RTS mode, where, in normal, well-structured games, the units are able to defend themselves. Sadly, though, this doesn't work. Repeatedly clicking of enemies or cover is necessary to complete the missions without dying over and over.

The voice acting and animation is... subpar, to say the least. Mouth movements don't look like mouth movements, the voice acting is too load or sounds too much like voice acting in parts, and animation is clumsy. Enemies run/act the same, your team shifts around and acts the same way, and idle animations are repeated over and over again. Graphics, like I mentioned before, are bad. Even the weapons--which should be a quality part of a FPS--appear to be no more than wooden models or something you would find in a children's toystore.

PROS -

- The RTS, while not exciting, is better than the FPS mode.

Cons -

- Bad graphics and animations leave the player wanting more.

- A.I. Your teammates are about as smart as the average housedog and will do nothing but follow you around, only shooting when you shoot at something (or, in RTS, until you click on the enemy.) Enemy A.I is about as intelligent as you are, so it's basically a lose/win situation.

- Story. The story leaves nothing to be desired. The bad voice acting, cutscenes and lack of more engaging visuals on loading screens makes for a boring story experience.

- Combat. What should be the central and most entertaining post of this game falls short in the fact that killing enemies is extremely difficult. A shot to the head usually kills someone, right? Well, not in this game--at least, not always. Multiple shots are required to kill one enemy.

- Environment. Like the graphics, the environment could be better done, and could feature more interaction. Houses are not destructible, even when hit with a rocket launcher or a bomb; trees, plants and rocks do not react to your presence, and lighting does not reflect off your weapons or characters (at least, as far as I could see.)

I would've given this game more of a chance were it not for the unbearable amount of things wrong or underdone with it. The fact that I made it through three-and-a-half levels was amazing enough. A FPS game should be engaging in combat, which it isn't, and an RTS should feature more strategy than simply moving units from point A to point B and killing characters. Special commands are extremely difficult to use, combat is frustrating, and the A.I is unbearable.

[FROM RAZER SUPPORT TEAM] ""We understand that the Razer Orbweaver Chroma is having a keypad glitch. We are sorry for the inconvenience.""

I really wanted to like this for gaming (especially the thumb buttons and joystick) as it's incomparable to a keyboard. With this pad, I was able to (finally) get as much thumb usage as possible (that's what she said...), and the flexibility that it offers from fitting adjustments is pretty decent!
I had the mechanical version, and if you're ok with the clickiness of the cherry blue, then you'll feel right at home.

But the main issue, and the reason why I wouldn't recommend this, is that within 2 weeks of usage (TWO WEEKS!) the bottom row of keys stopped working altogether, and the left column of keys start glitching where if you hit any key, it would register as that key, and the one to its right - VERY FRUSTRATING!
I tried all possible home remedies by re-installing the razer software, the driver, and even restoring my windows to a previous date, but no luck...
So I contacted support, and they (of course) recommended doing already what I did, but then they also admitted that this is a very known and common issue with the Orbweaver, and once looking up similar issues online, I noticed that this happens to a lot of owners (some had the issue from day 1, and some after 6 months).
Bottom line is, for $130, I don't want to gamble on a pad that lasts even 6 months, and I think I'm lucky to have run into this after 2 weeks, where I can still return to amazon.

So, yeah! I'd wait for the next version since the issue is with the hardware, not the software. And it sucks that this is the only pad with mechanical keys, so no other competitors to even try",Avoid until the next version,1526256000,7,{'Style:': ' Mechanical'},

The gameplay the entire scenario is built upon can, more than anything else, be described as simply glitchy. It bugs out constantly, leading to unfair deaths or do-overs. Some puzzles, like Vincenzo's workshop, are absolutely agonizing because of this.

The setting is nothing more than an idea: Cabaret. That's it. Nothing more.

The story is nonsense--a mash-up of heart-felt cliches and sexist family drama the player will not care about, with random (--wrong--) references to Einstein and generic ideas of science floating in the background. I guess it's meant to add depth to the universe they're creating, but it doesn't help when a handful of the world-building collectables are called nothing more than ""Science Drawing"" and are literally just nonsense symbols and images.

The story also just gets in the way: I can't count the number of times I'd move a few feet and have control taken away from me, so the camera can do a stilted, early PS2-era swoop over the surroundings, complete with lots of janky start-stop moments. Speaking of, the controls--movement and camera--also feel like the platformers (e.g., MDK 2) of the early '00s.

Except she's not. Almost immediately, she's let out of her cell. And the evidence she was locked up on was pretty poor stuff. Not the kind of serious frame you would think it would take to jail a world famous detective, not to mention the local prosecutor's daughter.

Anyway, Nancy roams around the police station using all of their stuff because ... the local police force has been downsized? Who knows. We never see anyone but the chief, though there are 4 unoccupied desks, an unoccupied lab, and an unoccupied reception area. She is in no peril at all, and the chief wants her to solve her own ""crime.""

To gather info, Nancy must call her friends and task them with jobs. They are apparently incapable of trading tasks between themselves, which makes this mechanic really clunky and annoying when it could have been fun. They also have limited conversations between each other. There's no fun observations or joking between George & Bess, and no sense of how George & Bess get on with Ned as their BFF's BF. It might as well be Nancy doing the legwork.

The suspects are interesting. I particularly liked Alexi and hope he appears in future games because his past as a kid detective is intriguing and connects well with Nancy's story.

There is a very big difference between feeling lightweight and feeling cheap. I bought a set of Bose Bluetooth headphones and while they feel very lightweight, the build quality is evident. The same is true for a set of Vmoda crossfades that I bought. The Vmoda feel extremely well made and cost a good bit less than these cheap plastic things that probably cost about $15 to make.

On top of that, I have had many sets of Turtle Beach headphones in my time and all of them have just lacked volume and had to be cranked up all the way or they were useless.

This grip is terrible for Monster Hunter (or any game that regularly uses the LR buttons OR the C-stick nub). If that is your intended use, then I would close this tab and never come back. The LR buttons are barely usable so you can completely forget about using the ZL/ZR buttons, not a chance. There really aren't very many grips for the N3DS regular (Not XL), especially ones that work for MH, but this is the best one I've found so far https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WU8EEAC/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0 I also have a review of it too.

The unfortunate thing about this grip is the material feels great, and the weird ""triggers/finger rests"" on the back feel great, IF you never use the LR buttons, its like it was designed without those in mind. However if you do use LR it forces you to hold the grip higher up than intended which cramps my hands and doesn't give you much to grip and either:
1. Forces you to stretch your index fingers up, and dangle the rest of your fingers down because they're blocked by the finger rests, or...
2. put your middle fingers on the finger rests, while your try to stretch your pinky and ring finger all the way down to the handles.
In addition to the previous problems, the grip juts out too far near the LR buttons meaning your finger will constantly be rubbing against the sharp 90 degree angle at the top. I think I have average sized hands so who knows maybe if you have very large hands this grip would work for you.
Overall, I wouldn't recommend it, especially at $33 at the time of writing this. If only the ergonomics of the grip were moved upward to accommodate using LR and the finger rests were removed this grip would be so much better.",Monster Hunters Beware!,1484438400,2,,

Granted, this game isn't as bad as some games in this genre can be, but it's simple not good. The graphics are weak, the sound is weak, the ai is weak and the storyline is weak.  You soon begin to release that this is no way to spent your time.

The first mission requires you to advance through the jungle while the night sets in. It has actually a kind of fitting atmosphere and isn't bad. Although it seems to drag on for too long. But there are some tell-tale signs of weakness.

At the start it is impressed upon you to avoid getting into a fire fight because there are over thousand enemy soldiers deployed in the area. Yet the game forces you down the first person shooter road, because you soon find out that gunning down soldiers is unavoidable, far less trouble and not penalised. The map is to small to circumvent the enemy. At some points ambushes are triggered and you have no choice but to fight it out man-to-man.

I have read some books and a field manual on sniping and it has a lot to do with avoiding standup fights. Sniping is about patience and getting that one shot right, that one shot being aimed at a high important target like a key person or installation. After the shot you relocate as fast as possible. This actually means that you are not there to shoot down everything and the entire mission should be built around that fact, IF your aim is to create a sniping game. But either the designers failed to grasp this essence or they wanted just to create a first person shooter where your weapon of choice is limited to a sniper rifle and a side arm.

If the first mission didn't give you enough hints, the second mission will do. You are now to advance in broad daylight through a village crawling with warned enemy troops. The civilians might or might not betray you and you can't shoot them, because then the game will end. If there was ever made an ill fitting mission for a sniper then this must be the one. And what is more, you simply have no choice in the matter. Any sensible guy would simply pull out and this then was what i proceeded to do.

I think that if someone wants to make a sniper game he should concentrate on what sniping entails. There are excellent books about it and if books aren't inspiring enough there are probably some veteran snipes who can tell you all about it. More could have been made of the interaction between the spotter and the sniper, with the player able to play both,for instance. Fitting missions, maps and story line would have to go along with this.

Simply arming the player with a sniper rifle doesn't turn a first person shooter into a sniping game and a first person shooter with only a sniper rifle is an akward first person shooter to say the least. This game will therefore please nobody.",Pleases nobody,1145232000,,,

It just made sense. Many of my friends were playing this game. This was the most hyped game in the history of PC gaming thus far. So, I gave it a try. The first time through the game was amazing. But, as you go along, there are far too many limitations and unpolished aspects of the game.

The Good

* The heroes. There are a wide variety classes - The Barbarian, Monk, Demon Hunter, Witch, and the Wizard. Lots of different characters to play with. Barbarian for the close range, physical prowess. Demon Hunter for the long range sniping and shooting ability. Witch and Wizard with spells and spiritual powers.

* Beautiful settings. Dirt, night, day, villages, fire, hell, heaven, everything looks gorgeous

* The first time through the game is epic, until the very last ACT. The ACT was just disappointing. I couldn't even believe when I killed Diablo. I figured it should have been a bit more difficult. Still, the first half and through the first part of the 2nd half is pulse pounding fun.

* Looting. It's quite fun. And addictive.

* Armor and weapons upgrading. Highly addictive to a certain extent. There are attributes that make certain armor and weapons more appealing, including vitality, regeneration, gold find, and so forth.

The Bad, Bad, Bad

* Required online log in. What? Are you kidding me? I have to log in and stay online just to play by myself. I should never have to lag when I am playing alone. A hiccup in internet connection is all it takes to die. If that happens in hardcore, oh that is no good at all.

* No voice chat function. That makes no sense at all. Valve has succeeded and made it a standard. It makes absolute no sense to force players to use the in-game text chat or other external programs like skype and ventrilo. Shame on Blizzard.

* The additional modes are not appealing. After you finish the game once, you enter Nightmare mode, and so forth. However, aside from higher difficulty, different items, and tougher monsters, there is really no difference. The same thing, again and again.

* I expected the graphics to be much better and refined. Zoomed in, the game just looks horrible and blocky.

Unfortunately, it isn't. The first annoying thing about it is the load times, or cut scenes, after you have seen your selected player be introduced and do a dance, you get very bored of it quickly, yet you can't just skip it and get back to the gameplay.

You get 1 mode at first called TV mode, then later on you can select the individual events you want to play I guess, I never bothered to play long enough to figure out how to unlock those. Whilst in gameplay, like the show, you must complete the obstacles just like on the show, so your first task is to use one of the buttons that make you either run, duck or jump while using the control pad to hold a direction. Had the developers taken to a control system like super Mario Bros then the game might have seemed like a bit of fun, but instead the controls are sloppy and you don't feel like you are in complete control of your character. Jumps don't seem to jump when you want them to, so your constantly having to pre-time things and figure to jump before you want to jump, or just try to speed through it and use the Force.

Some of the obstacles I don't know what the game developers where thinking when they made them so short. For instance, on the show, you have that spinning roller platform thing where you have to balance while running across and also jump over two moving clock like arms... in this game, it is very much like that, however, it takes about 2 seconds to complete, before the next obstacle takes about 5 seconds to load and let you have control of your character again. The constant small waiting times add up, and you don't know when you get control back or not, a simple GO icon might have helped, but nope, you start running and fall into the water.

And I must say the strategy of the game is hardly present. A few times you might know when to jump, but some things just have a mind of there own and there is no strategy other then either memorize what you previously did or just hope for the best, but there is no strategy to work out, it's just luck. The big balls can be easily crossed, and the punching wall is easy too, but everything else seems to have a mind of its own, but you'd think maybe the developers could come up with some way to make the game strategic and fun.

The commentary is annoying, as it's only a DS game it doesn't have a lot of capacity for many audio files, so expect to hear the exact same things every time you play. I just don't understand what game developers are thinking these days? What ever happened to strategy? Why is it a hand held console has the ability of the Super Nintendo and the Nintendo 64, yet developers can not take a look back in history to see how controls for a game should work? If they are going to make a game that does not require the stylus, then for god sakes, hire some programmers who know what they are doing when they design the controls and reaction time of these things and stop trying to make pretty pictures you can hardly interact with.",The game wipes out,1288915200,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Graphics wise, Shadow Ops is a mixed bag.  At times the textures seem clean, and extremely lush, others they muddy together.  But the real problem is the frame rate, which is just horrible at times.  And loading is another headache, along with some glitches that seem to be associated with disc access/loading.
Control is actualy good, when the frame rate keeps up with the action, the guns all have scope capability.  You can't pick up other enemy's guns, which really sucks actually.  And ammo for your weapon can get very scare in a heated battle.  And some missions are based on limited ammo, and advise you to use strategy.  Basically make your enemy spend all their ammo, then move in for the kill.  You get alot of controller set-up options, so you can customize how you want the button scheme.
Sound is just amazing!  Probably the saving grace of this title, you actually feel like you're in a movie!  Or in a real battlefield for that matter, with ambience from enemys, nature, explosions, echos from your teammates holloring out orders, etc.
The overall mission based theme of this game is just too A - B.  At times the action has a more furious arcade flavor, but then sometimes it takes on a more 'medal of honor', type of gameplay.
With so many FPSes out there, it's getting hard to be original.  Shadow Ops seems to be similar to Fugitive Hunter on the PS2, but just not as fun.  Better off to wait for DOOM 3, or Area 51.","a ""shadow"" of a First Person Shooter",1087344000,4,,
2.0,False,"10 26, 2015",A3D0UDP7T2SIFP,B00HHIPQ98,Josh,"Let's get this out of the way right now - I am a Tales fan. From the moment I played Tales of Destiny on PS1 over at a friend's house I was hooked. With a few exceptions (mainly spin off titles) I have played every Tales game. So I generally know what to expect.

Tales of Zestiria is one of the weakest entries for me, and I am a huge Tales fan. It's bland and mediocre in almost every regard. I can overlook a bad story and characters if the gameplay is stellar; or sub-par gameplay if the atmosphere and lore are something special; or a boring world if the writing is there to keep me engaged and moving forward. This game has none of that.

This is a PS3 game on the PS4; and a technically unimpressive one at that. The environments are very shallow and basic, and do nothing to stand out. It's all very bright and vibrant for the most part but that doesn't make up for the empty, hollow dungeons made up of nothing but walls and ceilings. The open fields between towns are much the same. A tree here, a rock there, and a few enemies wandering about. If you're going to depart from having a world-map type RPG, into an ""open world"" RPG  as they claim to have done, I am going to hold you to and judge you by that standard.

This is not an open-world game, there is just no world map. Which, I wish that there was a world map because trying to travel around by foot everywhere leads to a ton of backtracking and wasted time. You can fast-travel between save points for a ridiculous amount of gald (which is not viable unless you really, really want to) and even then the game restricts you from using that feature half the time. Getting from A to B in Tales of Zestiria is one of the worst time-sinks I've ever seen in a video game.

The story is what we've all come to expect from a Tales game. Our young, kind-hearted main character goes off to save the world after discovering that he is the chosen one who must stop the impending darkness. Through adversity, he discovers that friendship is the key to overcoming great peril. This is standard JRPG stuff, which can normally be overlooked if there is a good cast and some good dialog to go with it, but there isn't. Tales of Zestiria has one of the worst casts in any Tales game.

Which brings us to the greatest strength of the Tales series, and this game's biggest departure - the combat and leveling system. What really keeps me coming back to Tales is their signature, tried and true combat. This game changes it a bit. Instead of a normal attack, you have a series of ""martial artes"" which vary depending on what direction you hold the thumbstick when pressing O. You can string four of these together and unlock more as you level up. Hidden Artes and Seraphim artes are like the special attacks of old, but all three types of attacks draw from the same ""SP"" resource pool which regenerates when idle. There's also an interesting rock-paper-scissors dynamic, and the ability to fuse with your non-human party members. I find the new combat system to be okay, at level 52 I'm used to it. But it's not my favorite by any means. It's not as fast-paced and I'm unable to string together truly devastating combos like in past games. Also, the artes and mystic artes in general just leave something to be desired.

The leveling system is where I get most annoyed. You still level up through gaining experience, but it feels almost completely pointless and irrelevant. Herbs, a traditional item in Tales games which increase stats, are now your primary means of stat upgrades. But where your characters gain most of their strength is their equipment. Good equipment is not simply obtained in Zestiria. The fusion system is how you obtain better gear. But the system itself is incredibly, unnecessarily hard to understand and even harder to use when you do understand it. It would be different if I could just ignore it and continue on, but you can't - not if you want to play on higher difficulties. Each equipment piece can hold up to five skills, and each character has an equipment grid that these skills pop into. Gear drops or is bought with a random skill or 2 attached. Taking two pieces of the same gear and fusing will net you (possibly) new skills, and a slightly higher attack or defense value. The skill/grid part is what I hate. You have to line skills up along the grid vertically, horizontally, or through stacking to achieve further bonuses but when fusing equipment you don't choose which skills combine or get lost so the bonuses come and go and it's just a huge mess.

I really hope they can course correct with the next entry. I felt like they were torn between tradition and trying to innovate/revitalize the series, and ended up failing at both. Either stick to and refine what got you your success in the first place, and focus on executing what you already do on a really high level - or depart from tradition and give your all to trying new things (which, hopefully, they would have good ideas and not just be innovating to innovate.)",I can overlook a bad story and characters if the gameplay is stellar,1445817600,14,{'Color:': ' Playstation 4'},

I play strictly single-player.  I like being able to position my players where I want them.  The biggest pain in the butt with this game is that you can position your teammate where you want him, but then he'll saunter off on his own, or, worse yet, run out into the open, right into a hail of bullets.  You can place your teammate at a strategic location to watch your back, and next thing you know, you got killed from behind because your teammate decided to walk off, descend a ladder, and crouch behind a wall somewhere.  It's frustrating as all heck, because you're always switching players in order to regain control over the one that's moving around on his own, so you can put him back where you want him.  I can't believe none of the programmers caught this before the game was released.

It's also a lot easier for the enemy to kill you than it is for you to kill them.  Take three rounds, and you're toast.  But when you're fighting the enemy, unless you nail them square in the head, you may have to unload a lot of ammo to bring them down.

I contacted Amazon to see if it was under their warranty but they gave me a non working e-mail address to Nintendo. I had to contact Nintendo by telephone who said it should be under their 12 months (supposedly awesome) warranty. I shipped it to Nintendo and a few days later got an e-mail that the problem was not their fault, that the connecting pins were bent and broken. My son takes excellent care of his handhelds and has 2 previous models that haven't had issues. Now I can either pay Nintendo another $85 (about half what the system cost) to fix it or get it back broken.

We had played a demo of Once Upon a Monster where the game easily detected new players and all you had to do was wave.  But I had read excellent reviews of the playability of this game on Amazon, so we went ahead with the purchase of Kinect Rush.

My first criticism is the LONG setup process.  A kid can't just jump into the action - they first have to choose their gender, their color, and get scanned in (a painful process!).  Repeat for the next player!  We got stuck in this area and my son learned a few new vocabulary words.  I could have done it on my own (and did), but convincing him to do it himself (Kinect gets confused when parents jump in to help the kids get their hands in position) was mind-bogglingly difficult.

Once we were in the game together, I couldn't run.  He could run around, but I got stuck in place, moving my arms & legs and going nowhere.  Pretty soon I gave up, especially since the game had forgotten who I was and stuck me in the same ""default"" boy outfit my son was wearing (way to confuse us).  He finally found his way into ""Incredibles"" land, and my character popped in too, where we promptly got stuck and frustrated by the puzzle. You see, if only one person of the two can understand how to do the puzzle, unlike other Kinect games designed for kids, you get stuck because you have to wait for the other person to grasp it.  And, since moving around the screen was so difficult (more difficult than I've seen in any other Kinect game with absolutely NO guidance), we didn't get far.  To top it off, an annoying little girl kept telling us we were taking too long.

What I did eventually is go upstairs to rant to my spouse about this. However, my son called me down to play with him, at which point we shut the game off, and downloaded Once Upon a Monster.  We also wished we could return the game desperately, especially after finding out Amazon is selling it for half the price we paid for it.  (If you are going to buy this poorly-made game, buy it here on Amazon.)

It makes me so angry when people make a game for young children that is difficult to play or control.  Kinect games especially should make it easy for new players to join in without a hassle.  If a game developer can't figure out how to build things in the Kinect interface, then they should stick to the Joystick!  I can't believe game testers didn't come across these issues, and it would have been good to test the game on your target audience.

If even the adults are throwing up their hands and leaving the room (both experienced gamers who have played a number of other Kinect games and have been playing on consoles since the Atari 2600), then how is a kid supposed to figure it out?

It's a decent Star Wars game overall with nagging issues that keep it from being one of the better games for the system.

Set after the events in the movie Star Wars V: The Empire Strikes Back but before the events in the movie Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi (and also based on the book of the same name), you set out to help Luke Skywalker and rescue Princess Leia from the hands of Prince Xizor. Choose from 3 difficulty levels and battle through 9 levels set in planets that are part of the Star Wars universe; battling enemies and making your way around as you would in a platform game.

The PROS: Well, the overall presentation is good enough to make you feel you're in the Star Wars universe as the sound effects and music are what you expect to hear in Star Wars games. Even though the game has 9 levels, they are long levels so you won't be cruising through so easily.

The CONS: Unfortunately, this is not one of the better SW games available for the N64 for several reasons. This game was part of the first generation of games for the N64 and it shows. The graphics did not age so well and back in 1996 , they were horrible. Super Mario 64 was a launch title and it had way better graphics. Here, the game gets choppy when there's a lot of action, the frame rate dips every so often and there is lots of ""pop up"" scenery and dense fog (to cover up areas that don't have any animation.) The controls are no better than the ones in the PS title ""Tomb Raider"". Your character controls like a robot, aiming is a chore to do and the game has horrible collision detection. Add in the platform elements where you have to jump in certain areas and either you end up dying or trying to jump again because the jump button doesn't respond until a full second AFTER you press it. On top of all that, the game's difficulty is pretty unforgiving. Even if you set in on ""easy"", the enemies are still pretty tough and sometimes you have no idea if your weapons have an effect on whoever you are shooting at.

Considering that the first level is easily the best of the game altogether, you're pretty much hyped and can't wait to see the rest of the game. Unfortunately, when you do, you realize that the game falls flat on its face. Star Wars: SotE had a lot of potential. It's a Star Wars game and gives you the feeling that you're part of the awesome story it conveys.

Should I be killing randon redcoats?  Should I be fixing a boat so I can be a ship captain someday?  Should I be hiring people to work on my land?

THIS IS NOT A CIVILIZATION GAME
A great number of major features of this beloved series have been simply removed. A fellow gamer called this ""Civilization For Dummies"" and he is absolutely right.
There is no trading maps or technologies. There is no claiming resources outside your borders by building a colony. There is no need for transport ships as units apparently are now all..amphibious (and they need 15-20 turns to cross an ocean!). There are no city-growth milestone requirements (granary, aqueduct, refrigeration). There is no culturally conquering an enemy city (detonating a ""culture bomb"" by consuming a Great Artist will only get you extra territory tiles but no cities). There are no spies nor health/pollution balance. And there are no armies (please read on).

ARMY CASTRATION
Someone please tell me what was so wrong with armies that had to be yanked out? Napoleon almost conquered Europe with one army. Germany almost conquered the eastern hemisphere with three and the US still holds a two-and-a-half armies doctrine. How can a turn-based game be called Civilization unless one can emulate, well, a real civilization? Building an army, seasoning it on minor conflicts and then going for the enemy's capital was one of the most fun parts of any Civilization game. Why Sid, why?

YOU MAY BE ABLE TO LAUNCH INTO SPACE YET CANNOT CLIMB MOUNTAINS?!
Movement should be hindered by rough terrain. Units that have 3 or 4 moves on the plains should not be expected to do more than 1 or 2 on a mountain, right? Well, no. Mountains seem to be those magical places no unit can climb or pass through (not even ...helicopters of jet fighters!). And I cannot see how this makes for more complicated strategic decisions than timing your movements, claiming the high ground and having a bonus for elevated artillery?

UNIT STAMPEDE
A major issue for me, this was what really ruined the game. For some unfathomable reason units cannot be stacked. A worker can coexist with a military unit but that's it. Artillery and shock-cavalry are very vulnerable to attacks and (with the new hexagon layout) one would need ...six defensive units to protect a single artillery battery.
As a result, units keep getting on each other's way (especially when ordered to move for distances that require more than a turn), they refuse to even pass through friendly units (!) and the ""tactical"" considerations that result from this are trivial. And whenever besieging an enemy city, one has to endlessly maneuver his units around it (while exposed to its bombardment) whereas wounded units are never easy to withdraw.
You cannot even garrison more than a single unit within a city. Not that it would make a difference, since the garrisoned unit is not automatically awaken to fight back when the city is under attack(!), the city is left to defend itself.

CAN YOU REALLY COMMAND WITHOUT A...CENTRAL COMMAND?
The economy is nose-diving into the red and you want to reduce the percentage going into research for a while to avoid having units of yours deleted one by one? The fickle people of your civilization are unhappy and you want to placate them by increasing their entertainment allocation? You have discovered conscription and you want to upgrade all your musketeers into recruits? Well, TOUGH LUCK! There is not central command screen to do so. Only advisers that you have to thank for annoying you.
You have zero control of both your cities resource distribution and your national economy. And units have to be hunted down and upgraded one by one.
Speaking of the economy, when are going to see a Civilization game where one can run and manage a national debt?

NO FREE EYE-CANDY IN THIS UNIVERSE. NOT EVEN A STALE ONE.
The game does look new and polished and the units are well designed but not cutting edge and not without a steep hardware price. If you expect anything comparable to STARCRAFT II crispiness you will be disappointed - at my 1280x1024 resolution it is not easy to discern roads from railroads.
The system I am running my copy was top of the line about a year ago and still I had to tweak the video settings with a mix of high and medium to get it running. Even then, whenever I scroll to a different location of the map, I can see the image fleshing out, just like zooming in a Google-Earth map.
So one can only wonder: why should one need a...Cray to run a Civilization game at full?

STEAM OF WAR
The game requires OnLine Activation (and rumored perpetual reactivation every few days) and has to be tied to a STEAM account. Effectively this means that the game is a piece of rentware the buyer never really owns and yet it is sold at full price. I realize that to some people this may not be a serious issue so, in case you are wondering, I deducted a single star from my overall rating of the game because of its DRM scheme. To every other gamer however, you can now make an informed decision.

This was a major disappointment. I never though I'd say this but I while playing the latest Civilization game I caught myself wondering if they would ever make...CALL TO POWER III.

New gamers, steer clear of this mess, this is NOT what a Civilization game plays like.
Seasoned gamers, we know better than to call this a Civilization game.

Pokmon players will understand when I say that she's like the Magikarp of the Skylander world, she's wimpy and a pain to level

Her defenses are what literally slay her, she has bad defenses, very weak, her bone fence will get taken out by tankier enemies easily and she dies quickly in a mob of anything but the weakest of enemies. If you decide to get her and play with her then get her hats and charms to ramp up her defenses or you will die a lot.

Her attack isn't much better, you have to power up her skull rain attack and while she's not the only Skylander who does this, she gets her attacks off slowly even with upgrades and there's a delay between when you push the attack button and when she launches her attack and it only takes an enemy bumping into you to disrupt it, her accuracy and critical hit is cruddy.

She's not a slow character when it comes to just moving around

Upgrades, hats and charms don't help her much and it's difficult to try to boost her stats in Cali's Challenges, Brock's Arena Challenges and I wouldn't recommend her in PvP mode.

I got rid of my Hex because I was just frustrated and disappointed and while the character mold looks good her arms are prone to ripping if your not careful. I had to have mine glued because her rubbery, thin arm got a tear in it.

In a sentence: This game has been compared to the Bioshock, Doom, and many other very well made games series, I find this to be an unfair comparison.

In a paragraph: Going back to the year 1955 seems like this is an all to familiar concept with the likes of Michael J. Fox popping into my head but never the less this is exactly what these game developers having you doing.  The main premise of the plot is to stop the evil Russians from world domination, once again this seems like a plot that has been done and done and done to death.  In a nutshell the story is weak, and I didn't feel compelled to pick up the controller and finish the game at breakneck speed as I did with Bioshock series.  Games like Bioshock are akin to an addictive drug, I am not sure where but at some point when playing a well made game I allow myself to become  eating, sleeping and drinking deprived because I become too engrossed into the story of the game, this never happens with Singularity. Believe me Raven tries very hard to copy critical Bioshock elements, as an example leaving tape recorders with taped messages which are suppose to add to the plot but sadly most of the time they just say the same thing, E99 is bad/good, experimentation on humans is not good/bad, blah blah blah. The tape recorders are placed a lot in the beginning and some at the end, but not consistent and they add very little to the plot.  The other elements that the developers copy badly is the left hand TMD powerglove and the right hand control which is for the gun element.  The problem here is this powerglove looking device never seems to be as powerful at killing the mutated humans as the guns are at least not in the beginning to middle, so I found myself not using it very much.  Also the gun locker idea is a terrible construct; why only allow us to carry 2 guns? Due to this limitation they then force us to choose which two weapons we want, why???  If your going to have the ability to upgrade your weapon then once you find the weapon locker make them a single use item and the same goes for upgrading your TMD powers. On to the graphics Singularity uses the unreal engine which when applied here seemed a bit dated and a bit sluggish, as an example dead bodies twitch and jerk around long after they should. Ok ok I am harping on just the negative as there truly are a few bright spots, they created one big bad boy gun called the Seeker and I must say it is the coolest gun in the game, the gun actually slows time down and you have control over the bullets direction, this was a very fun and unique aspect of the game.  Here again though you get use this gun 3 or 4 times throughout the game and it never becomes a gun that you get to keep in your arsenal, once you run out of ammunition the gun isn't worth carrying anymore. Lastly, the story ends by giving you an ethical dilemma, which is fine but why incorporate this element only at the end? This could have been used several times throughout the game, but instead they decide to use this only once and for me adding it at the end seems like an afterthought.

Some positives:  Seeker weapon was Great! Playing with the time aspect is also Great! Mostly the production value is very good.

Suggestions to the game developers: More Seeker weapon time, a complete rewrite of the story is in order, Don't try so hard to be like another game, be inventive on your own.  Get rid of the weapons lockers and just allow the player to carry all weapons.

It's a handheld title that rivals its console brethren on most levels, namely sound, graphics and content. If you've played an Assassin's Creed game before, this experience is not far different from games in the past and you'll quickly find yourself running, traversing and assassinating enemies with the familiar tools of the trade. For brief sections, this game is a lot of fun and exactly what an Assassin's Creed fan would want from a handheld Assassin's Creed game.

Unfortunately, the development team behind Liberation found it necessary to fill the game with Vita-specific gimmicks that aren't intuitive enough or don't work as well as they should in concept. These include tilting and turning the system to complete various puzzles, rubbing two fingers across both touch screens similar to ripping open an envelope and holding the camera up to a light source to reveal mission-specific secrets. These moments will quickly sour your experience because they are light on instructions, tricky to master, and often don't work. With the number of times you'll have to restart sections or redo certain puzzles, you'll begin to question whether this shortcoming is an issue with the Vita's hardware or sloppy tech poorly implemented by Ubisoft. Besides the newly introduced mechanics, Liberation does find itself with the same issues that previous Assassin's Creed games have had as well. The parkour elements of the game (running, climbing, jumping from rooftop to rooftop) are all there in their same glitchy glory and are just as infuriating and frustrating as their console counterparts.

In short, there are multiple 5 to 10 minute sections of Liberation that feel great, are quick and responsive and work just like you would expect them to.

For example, the overall gameplay is very bad. 18 levels long you'll have to pull a switch, go through an opened door, whack some baddies and pull a switch again and go through a door again and... you get my point.

Instead of the usual sword era with green countrysides, there are modern towns and cell phones. The feel is completely different, which is why I say it does not feel like a Tales game. The protagonist is silent, but during certain parts of gameplay, cut-scenes, two choices pop up. Some are timed choices. You pick the trigger button that corresponds with the choice on the left or right. Many of them are dialogue choices that determine how close you are to your companions, etc. Choose to make your special tomato omelet OR  make the bratty little girl something without tomatoes. I think this is put in place to make the game feel more modern and more interactive, and I don't dislike it. I don't dislike the very different modern and gritty look to the towns either. What I do dislike, is the always changing battle system, and the always changing level up powers method. In every game it changes. Xillia added more than just basic sword and magic attacks, it adding partnering. This adds more partnering but it doesn't feel the same.
The system for leveling up magic and power was perfect in TOH and I would be happy with that method for all the games. Even TOX had a web that was not as user friendly, but not such a pain. This system is more complicated and not fun. What IS the same as TOX is the fields. No changes. In between chasing story events, you can choose missions in town such as gathering supplies or defeating enemies.
Major gripes?
The map. The icons are so teeny tiny that you can't read them anyways even with the map open to full view. There is. No. Zoom. It doesn't always tell you what is where, so memorize it over time, or go with trial and error. The power up grid. No wheels, no webs, but instead a new web.. evolution...
The debt repayment stalker. You owe a ton of money. It restricts movement. First you can't take the train, then you can't cross certain borders. But once you earn a larger amount of money from battles, fields, and missions, you cannot take more than 6 steps without being assaulted by the pop up reminder that you owe money. How annoying is it? It's the face and voice of the annoying way too happy debt collector girl popping up on your screen in the form of some kind of futuristic video surveillance. Pay us. Or I will never go away. You can pay her 50 a time out of spite for her annoyance, but paying her more will get her to go away.
Overall, I find myself unable to read a map I can't see, the background feels foreign and too modern for Tales, the power ups system is annoying, and the connective battle elects I didn't love in TOX are amplified here.
I want TOH's battle, Artes, power ups, villages, field travel, maps, town identification on maps...and applied to future games. It's suppose to be smoother, not harder. I would like this better if it had been given a different name and been named as a spin-off. I will finish the game one day, but right now there are too many other games out there.","I WANT to like it...A Dark & Gritty Modern Tale That Doesn't Feel Like ""Tales""",1424995200,,{'Style:': ' Standard Edition'},

1. Camera controls are horrible on the 3DS version, very unnatural... requires the claw.
2. There are limits on grinding potential causing you to plateau on difficult bosses making progression a war of attrition and potion chugging as you may run out of time (the quaropeco for instance).
3.  The AI companions are worthless besides getting the enemies attention.
4. The Co-op sucks unless you live near friends with the game (The WiiU has proper online making it easier to progress).

  Those are the primary issues I have regarding the game, I think it tooks gorgeous and has a great amount of content but points 1 and 2 really are gamebreakers for me, especially point 1.  I can't tell you how many times I would get smacked around due to poor camera controls on the 3DS version, the D-pad is too low to hit with your thumb from the analog stick (unless you have large hands) and the touchscreen pad is even worse due to accuracy reasons.

2.0,False,"10 14, 2014",A2WWV0K7B2SRUY,B00JDOX2SG,J. Cummings,"If you've played Borderlands or Borderlands 2, there isn't much that's going to change for you.  For better or worse.

In fact, you could be mistaken thinking you ARE playing Borderlands 2, as Borderlands TPS uses the same graphical engine as Borderlands 2.  However, there isn't as much of a change of scenery (Your opinion of this will vary, as Borderlands was just a big desert for the most part, and TPS is just the moon save for one section in a moon base).

Borderlands TPS still drops loot.  Your ""random is random"" luck will vary.  No real change in drop rates from Borderlands 2.  You will still need to do an inordinate amount of grinding through sections and bosses in order to get legendaries.  If there's a single most disappointing feature of the game, that would be in the running.

There is an crazy amount of clipping as well, through rocks, walls, etc. that should be solid.  The series is showing its age on the PS3.

Low gravity is definitely a hook, and it adds a dimension to combat, but if you're thinking Halo tight, you're thinking wrong.  Just as important, you can literally get yourself stuck on an early mission (if you fall to the floor below, you will have absolutely no way to get back up and it's a main story mission, so the only remedy at this stage would be to begin an entire new character).

The sound and music are all still very good, which has been the norm for this series throughout.  However, in terms of voice over, I hope you like Australian accents because that's a ton of the game. (Apparently Elpis was colonized by them, who know the outback was to the moon?)

As far as the story, it's not even close to as good as Borderlands 2, but more than what Borderlands 1 did, if only in that it's pretty much impossible to not have a better story than the first one did.  They had a great opportunity to show Jack off and it just fell flat for me.  The banter between the Vault Hunters can be pretty entertaining though.

The big ""hook"" of the new Vault Hunters is Claptrap, and while Borderlands 2's guys were enhancements of Borderlands 1's crew, each one seems different enough that it's worth going through the game with each, as long as you can tolerate all the things I listed above, and what I'm listing now:

- Remember having to start Borderlands 2 over again and having to go through the same long, boring sequence?  It's just as mind-numbing in Borderlands:  TPS.  If you're a first time player to the series, you'll appreciate the nuances.  If you're someone like me who has put in 300+ hours in both games, it just drags on, and on, and on
- The first raid boss is...no different than the final boss.  In fact, it IS the final boss, albeit trumped up.  This smacks of a mail in, as every raid boss in Borderlands 2 was different.
- The grinder has been added, yes you CAN get legendaries from it (it's one of the achivements of the game), but that only means you're crossing your fingers that the grinder god will give you a legendary instead of farming and getting one to drop.
- There can be SO MUCH going on at once (especially with Claptrap) that it obscures the screen to a point you have no idea what's hitting you or even where they are.  That of course is a sentence to put you into FFYL and a respawn.
- Side quests.  Oh, the humanity.  It's pretty much like this:
*I need you go to here
*Oops, somethings broke, go fix it
*Ok, now you're in but I need you to attach X # of objects
*Finally, everything is complete.  Come on back
*Walk/Moon Jump about 5-7 minutes to get back where they are
*Minimal reward
Now, about the ONLY thing they are mostly good far are getting a couple unique items and EXP, which you'll definitely need as the game has many hard stops (meaning, you'll need to be 2-3 levels above the section/boss you are fighting to get past it).  But nothing's changed from Borderlands 1 or 2 in this department and it's REALLY getting old Gearbox.

In short, while there is a season pass to the game like Borderlands 1 and 2, which means GBX is committed to producing new content, your enjoyment of Borderlands:  TPS is directly tied to your experience as a Borderlands player.

If you've never played the series before, go and pick up Borderlands 2 GOTY edition.  For $15-20 bucks, you'll getting a much better game, experience, story, and depth.  I wouldn't want you to form an opinion on just the basis of this game while GBX is working on Borderlands 3 for next-gen.

If you have played Borderlands 1 and 2, and like 2 especially, then this will be more of the same goodness for you and you should definitely buy it.  Whether or not you should do that at the $60 price point is largely your preference.

UPDATE #1:  10/17/2014

I am removing another star from this game.

In starting another new character, I am finding I got VERY lucky on my first playthrough.

There are no less then THREE main missions at the moment that have game breaking bugs (i.e., if you get stuck on that mission, you have 2 possible options, start a brand new character or join someone in a game that completes the mission while you're with them).  These two things do NOT always fix the issue.  There are threads upon threads in the Gearbox Forums talking about these and others (again, there are plenty of side missions that are bugged as well).

It's unacceptable for Gearbox to release a game in which you cannot progress through the main story without missions breaking.

If Gearbox patches all of these main mission bugs out, I will think about restoring a 3rd star to my rating.

Just FYI...in over 300 hours of playing Borderlands 2 starting over 12 different characters, not ONCE did a main mission bug out on me.  That's because Gearbox developed the game completely on their own.

The long running Guilty Gear series, considered by many to be the best 2-D fighting series on the market in the past few years, makes it's debut on the DS with Guilty Gear: Dust Strikers; and it does the aforementioned three things that third party DS games tend to do.  Utilizing both of the DS' screens for fighting mayhem, Dust Strikers moves the game's traditional one on one fighting format into an all out four player free for all, and it's not for the better.  Thanks to an unbalanced fighting engine and the game's haphazard use of the dual screens, the fighting action becomes nothing but one big messy button masher.  Not to mention that for a Guilty Gear game, there is hardly as much depth to it as we've seen before on other editions of the series.  There's also some lame mini-games thrown in for good measure using the stylus and touch screen, which are hardly worth even checking out.  There are a few good points to Dust Strikers though: the character sprites and graphics and animation look crisp, clean, and sharp most of the time.  Plus there's a heaping amount of fighters to pick from which is a nice plus for longtime fans of the series; and of course, there's a rocking soundtrack to boot as fans would come to expect, although it does sound a bit grainy coming through the DS' small speakers.

Later versions of Test Drive for PC added better graphics and better physics, but otherwise remained the same.  This Xbox version is more or less on the same track (no pun intended).  The graphics is good but not much better than the PS2 version.  The gameplay is basically the same -- let's race and outrun the cops! -- although there's a mode (""underground"") with a storyline and another where you play the cop and tag the six racers to ""arrest"" them.  There are four cities to choose from, and a seemingly large number of tracks.
What frustrates me about this game is, in the basic racing mode, you have to be #1 to win the race and unlock the goodies.  And this is very difficult to achieve, because the AI competitors are unforgivingly fast (even though at times they seem a little ""stupid"" as they crash into walls and other cars -- eventually they always beat you).  Plus, it's very easy for you to crash into walls and other cars -- the car physics model is somewhere between arcade and serious simulation -- and if you do this once in a race, there's pretty much no way you can finish 1st; so you'll need start the race over.

You are looking for a terrorist who blew-up a passenger plane (the very first cut-scene when the game starts). You are supported by secret agent office staff like Mina...a typical modern day woman with lots of attitude.

Is it an RPG? The box says so. You really can't tell what you're going to say, and your choices are timed. For example, your response choices may be something like ""passive, aggressive, suave, or happy"". Pick one. The problem is that you can't tell what you're going to say based on words like that. Unlike some games, your character actually speaks (instead of you just selecting a response and listening to what the other person says). But your response is timed; you don't have much time to think about each of the word choices based on the conversation. If you don't respond in time (5 seconds or less), then your answer becomes whatever your cursor happens to be highlighting at the time. I don't call that RPG. Also, does it really matter what you say? I got the impression that it doesn't.

The mini-games (like hacking and lock picking--which are essential to completing missions) are not very responsive to keyboard and mouse controls. This is especially true of hacking, which is incredibly awkward and frustrating when using a keyboard and mouse.

I got bored with this game after a short while and stopped playing. For me, the story was boring, not engaging, nothing new. The RPG was poorly executed. The mini-games were annoying. The controls/menu system were clunky. I'm not sure if I'll try to play it again. Honestly, I'd rather re-play other/better games I've played in the past, than try to play this one.

I purchased it new from an amazon seller called ""the General Store"". I paid 2 bucks.

2.0,True,"11 1, 2011",AD3EX5UG7UZPB,B000CBWQUY,Marcos,"As said in other reviews, Nintendo offers little support for this. The idea is if you don't have a wireless modem or router, but do have an internet connection (i.e. via a wired DSL modem or broadband modem) you can use this device to connect your DS, DS lite, DSi, and I suppose 3DS (not sure) to the internet via your computer's USB.
The problem is, it doesn't always work, and, it is very expensive new. IF you do purchase one of these, buy it used and cheap so if you don't have luck with it you don't waste a lot of money. It doesn't matter if it comes with the disk, you can get the drivers off of Nintendo's website, the last I knew. Beyond that, though, Nintendo offers no support for the device. A shame, since it is a good idea.
I don't think this works with Vista or 7, not sure about MAC, only tried on XP. If you do buy a device like this, however, I do recommend that you buy THIS ONE, the one made by Nintendo - I tried another device from a 3rd party company that was supposed to do the same thing and it was complete junk. The software didn't work, the hardware was shoddy (it felt like the device was going to fall apart).",Great idea however Numerous problems,1320105600,3,,
2.0,False,"05 18, 2013",A1OEQP3GWNG263,B00B1N07QM,Matt Dunphy,"I'm a veteran keypadist: 3 Belkins over the years, a G13, a Thrustmaster Tacticalboard, Ideazon FANG, and most recently this.

The summary is that the pad keys are decent, the thumbstick/button part is really bad, and the software has a long way to go. I shelled out for the ""Stealth"" version of this that has the lighter switches and less snappy sound. I really like Razer's boards and mouse products. I'm typing this on a Razer BlackWidow board with a Razer Naga Epic mouse right now, both of which I would re-buy if they broke tomorrow. This I would not and I may even inquire about returning it.

I'd rate this product as a miss. The only thing it really has over the G13 is the adjustability of the palm pad and thumb column, a feature which is in my opinion vastly overrated. No matter what position you put these things in, it's not going to overcome the fact that you'd have to have snakes for fingers to comfortably reach every key on the pad, nor is that going to save the delicate-feeling short-throw thumbstick, or make the up/down positioning of the thumb buttons any easier to hit.

At almost TWICE the price of a G13 with far less features than the G13, and most of the same features done worse than the G13, I can't recommend this at all. Razer needs to take a seriously hard look at the G13 and not release a product that costs twice as much unless it's definitely twice as good. This is, seriously, half as good.

Software is important on these things. Razer's software, Synapse, is horrible and I could write several pages on exactly why, but I'll try to limit myself. It's small, black, hard to read, and difficult to use. Other software has dialog boxes that are bigger than the main window of Synapse. It's also very hard to see at a glance what exactly you have programmed. This is less of a problem for their mouse and keyboard products, as those have less of a need to be usable and less frequently, but with a keypad you need to see the whole thing at once.

Logitech's software eats Synapse for lunch in terms of usability. You can instantly see every key's current setting, give them your own friendly names that are different from the keystroke (like ""JUMP"" instead of ""SPACEBAR""), the macro recording interface is easy and intuitive, and you can drag and drop things right onto the keys to set them, even drag one key's program to another key. Plus you can do even more advanced things like Lua scripting; Logitech also publishes an API. Synapse is years behind this in every way. It also has other annoyances like not returning to a default profile once you're done with a game; the profile will stick and you have to manually change it back, or launch another profile-activating game.

Synapse's cloud features are also vastly overrated. When you WANT to have your settings transfer over to every computer you plug it into, that's nice, but if you don't, this feature is annoying. I have two computers connected to a KVM switch and when I go from one to the other I want to retain settings per each box. Not an option when it synchronizes to the cloud and restores your settings to whatever it thinks you were last using. To say nothing of the fact that you've got yet another piece of software running in the background and wanting an always-on cloud connection, requiring a login and pestering you when it can't connect. Logitech, by contrast, uses the software settings on each box and if you really want to transfer, you can actually store a profile in the device memory itself to persist from machine to machine without this cloud nonsense. Don't get me wrong, clouds are cool. Just not for everything.

Back to the hardware: The thing has a nice matte rubberized finish and if you're addicted to mechanical keys (I am, but I honestly find I'm not liking the concept on a keypad. Typing is a different thing from game-button-mashing), the pad keys are good. Again, you'll never be able to hit them all comfortably no matter how you adjust it; you have to both curl your fingers to near-fist and super-reach to get them all. This is simply a physical problem for this kind of device and you have to prioritize what keys you're going to use, how and for what. I frequently don't even program hard-to-reach keys. The Orbweaver doesn't make any advances in this department.

The thumb column with buttons and stickpad is a total loss. The stickpad has a super short soft-click throw and is small, which means that you'll frequently mash it in the wrong direction accidentally. It also feels delicate, but in a couple of weeks of use I didn't break it; still, it just feels janky. Honestly Belkin had thumb control done right in the original N52, with the indented cross D-Pad like on game controllers. There was no mistaking what direction you were pressing and it conformed to the curve of your thumb. Why anybody thought putting a stick on it was better I'll never know. The lower thumb bar is far below the stick and is slushy. It doesn't give a positive end or click to being pushed. Bad. The upper thumb button, which was admittedly awful on the N52 and slightly better on the N52te, is finally good. However it's mounted so high it makes it difficult to press frequently and very uncomfortable in multi-key combos, so they still haven't really cracked the code on that yet.

Also, hilariously, the thumb stickpad functions either as a 4-direction pad or an 8-direction mode shifter--and these modes are represented by 3 dim LEDs that are tilted away from your line of sight. That means that if you are insane enough to want to switch between several modes in the heat of battle (The G13 has 3 and the N52 had 4, and I've never needed more than 2, personally), you have to A) be precision enough to move that tiny stickpad to the right position, B) have memorized the combinations of lights and positions on the LEDs that represent the mode it's in, and usually C) tilt forward to take a look at those lights to make sure your precision thumb move made it go into the right mode. I mean, why not just have to tap it out in Morse code while we're at it? That'd probably be easier.

As other reviewers have noted, you can have this in any color you want as long as it's black with green backlighting. The G13 lets you have any backlight color you want, and the backlighting can switch with what mode it's in, too. Another fail there.

To sum up: Yeah, the G13 is still the reigning king here and I'm back to using my 4-year old one which shows no signs of dying anytime soon, so its build quality is solid. All devices of this type have design weaknesses and personal preference can cause you to take one over another, but at THIS price, this level of overall design and software weakness is unacceptable. If you're looking for a pad, look at the G13 first, as it does a whole lot more a whole lot better for a whole lot less.",Razer good. Orbweaver bad.,1368835200,11,,

If anything, I found WC3 to be a step in the wrong direction.  The single-player campaign is so highly scripted it feels like a Sierra game, where every two minutes the computer takes control away from you and you have sit and watch another cut scene.  The maps are very restrictive, with narrow pathways (you can't walk through wooded areas) channeling you down one or two directions in every level.  This left me feeling claustrophobic.
The levels make the game feel more like an old 1D side-scroller than a modern, open-ended ""3D"" game.  The combination of heavy scripting and tightly constrained levels means there is zero replay value in the single player campaign.

This review is more for those who have to think twice about shelling out sixty dollars for each of these games (which in my opinion does contribute to the overall rating of the product).

The main criticism of this game is as follows: Why, in this day and age with the power of the PS3, does this game have fixed camera angles?  It is essentially still a side-scroller.  If you have played the previous versions, it is pretty much the same.  Not that you really have to for game play, but there is no ability to explore the environment. Sometimes, you just want to be able to look around--frustrating at times.  This also affects combat scenes since you are unable to get any different angles on your enemies.

Perhaps not a big deal to some, but this was the one change I was expecting from the newest version on the PS3.  In fact, if you were to randomly change between GOW 3 and the God of War Collection (God of War I and II remastered for the PS3), which I also own and have played through, I am willing to bet that most would be unable to figure out quickly which game you were playing, (outside of a few minor differences).

Again, the purpose of this review is not to bash this game. I love this series and GOW 3 is a fun game to play. But is this a significant enough upgrade to be shelling out top dollar?  As a God of War fan, definitely worth owning, but not at full price.  Get it a a discount and I think you will be less disappointed with the value.

3.0,False,"01 1, 2007",A1HX04JEY9MR3,B000HCJD68,C. Bakehorn,"The PSP launched in March 2005 with only a few games that really took advantage of its hardware or unique features. One of the few that did was Sony Online Entertainment's Untold Legends: Brotherhood of the Blade. It was a game that had potential, and that potential has been brought to another Sony launch, that of the PlayStation 3. How does SOE's Untold Legends: Dark Kingdom fare in the next-gen, non-handheld environment? To say it bluntly, fair. Very fair.

The Dark Kingdom suffix refers to the storyline's location of Dureth, a land victimized by dark magic, a demented king, and his legions of soldiers attacking defenseless, innocent civilians. Luckily for Dureth a group of gifted soldiers known as the Dragon Shade are there to save the day. From here one picks from three different Dragon Shade combatants: the brutish warrior, the swift scout, or the mystical mage. This begins a 20-hour adventure, as one of those characters sets out to discover what's driven the dark king to his madness.

Untold Legends feels a whole lot like every other 3D dungeon-crawling hack-and-slash. For the most part combat consists of mashing different combinations of the X and Square buttons to perform direct or sweeping attacks that absolutely devastate a pack of enemies. It's repetitive but that's to be expected from the genre and design. It's hard to grow tired of destroying a legion of skeleton swordsmen, to be entirely truthful. In fact, it's only when combat is taken away from the player that the game starts to become frustrating. Between hacking and slashing creatures the player will often perform jumping and platforming puzzles as well as some that will have one's head spinning for a moment before it is discovered what will allow one to move on. These puzzles go a long way towards making the game a little more than just a hack-and-slash, but at its core, that's all it really is anyway.

Leveling up is always enjoyable in RPGs (or should be) and Untold Legends is no different. Defeating enemies earns the player experience points that allow the character to level up. When leveled up, the character's stats can be increased (health, mana, melee damage, defense, etc.) and new magic attacks can be learned or strengthened. It is all too generous that Untold Legends allows the player to power up one of the nine magic skills at every level up; at level 45 one will have every single skill maxed out. Still, it's quite fun to beef up the characters. The game allows one to customize a lot; for example, it is possible to focus on strengthening melee damage and health points to make an indestructible warrior or emphasize ranged magic attacks and mana points for mages.

Throughout the game the player will also absorb essence from fallen enemies and destroyed objects (similar to Devil May Cry). Yellow essences act as currency and allow the player to purchase new item enhancements as well as red essences (heals the character) or blue essences (restores mana). Red and blue orbs are also found on fallen enemies. The only problem with the essence system is that the purpose of yellow orbs is defeated when one has to purchase pricey red and blue ones from save checkpoints if health or mana dips too low.

It hasn't yet been said but Untold Legends plays and looks a lot like Peter Molyneux's Xbox blockbuster Fable. One could take that two different ways. The first is as a compliment, because Untold Legends plays like one of the best Xbox games ever created, and this reviewer's personal favorite hack-and-slash game. The second is as a big insult, because a next-generation video game is being compared to a last-generation one. The combat system, essence-collecting, level-up system, and general gameplay mechanics are all remarkably similar.

Sadly, the visuals aren't much better. Untold Legends has pretty environments, lots of particle effects, and an interesting art design but the animation is just terrible. The Havok engine is put to use here but only sparingly. The camera is the bane of the entire game; it very often gets snagged on trees, boxes, or anything protruding from a wall. This results in it spinning wildly and the player taking extra time to figure out which direction to continue battling. At the very least, the music is pretty darn good and fits the environments and storyline quite well. It's just too bad that the sound effects don't compliment this for a great audio score, because they're very dull and powerless.

Untold Legends: Dark Kingdom is a fun game. It is quite fun to play alone for 20 hours or online with three other friends (it's even free, and one can use the experience earned here in the single-player game). Hacking and slashing might be mindless but it doesn't feel too boring or old in Dark Kingdom. Still, a few problems like ho-hum effects and a bad camera keep it from being a truly great game. Untold Legends: Dark Kingdom is worthy of purchase for those PlayStation 3 owners looking for something to keep them busy until bigger titles come out next year, but that's all.",This tale's been told before.,1167609600,41,,

-The driving is very similar to Hot Pursuit, so is the gameplay and races. Yes you can make the car do a 180 or turn on a dime. Cop chases are super fun and difficult. It's no easy task to get away from them especially the more heat you get. Getting busted has consequences (you lose all the speed points you have been racking up).

Mixed feelings- The online is nice sometimes when you want to race real drivers, but they like to smash into you a lot. It can be laggy, but I have not had too many issues with it. I mostly play single player and enjoy that mode the most.

The bad- There is one persistent bug that really pisses me off. I can be driving along and all of a sudden my car will freeze in place while the environment loads up. The problem with this is it can last anywhere up to 5 seconds and all the while everything but you continues on (the racers, the cops, and the timer all continue while you are temporarily frozen in place).
- No wheel support for a racing game...
- Barely any cars. Only 24 cars for racers and 24 cars for cops. Maybe I am just spoiled by Gran Turismo and Forza.
- Crappy car customization. It's enough to keep me happy, but don't expect Midnight Club level customization. Heck even GTA V had better car customization.
- Absolutely no way to pause the game (what nincompoop decided that) I understand for online, but even in single player you can't pause.
- EA sucks

Overall I feel like this is a combination of Hot Pursuit and Most Wanted (the latest ones). I enjoyed both of those games much better than this one. I will say this game is still quite a bit of fun on PC and if they fixed a few things it could be even better. If you are really desperate for a racing game then this one is good enough despite it's problems that I could recommend it.","Fun, but has some glaring issues.",1387411200,7,{'Format:': ' Software Download'},

I did have a lot of fun with the game, but while playing the game, I kept of thinking as to how this game could be so much better.  It is no secret that this is a 3DS game and that the developer did not bother to make anything better in the transfer to the Vita version.  The movies are grainy, and Vita has shown in the past that it can show movies in high definition.  There is no free roaming and there are no vehicles.  The background colors are darker and less vibrant.  I have played the PS3 version, and it is an amazing experience.  While I don't expect the Vita version to handle the PS3 version, I do expect it to come pretty close.  Vita has shown that it can play PS3 games (for example: Sly Cooper, All-Star Royale, Most Wanted, Ninja Gaiden 1 and 2, Mortal Kombat, and a few others).  So it comes down to one thing: the developer wanted to save money by having one and the same game for both 3DS and Vita.  I do think that this type of disregard for the Vita version does turn away customers, and I know that Traveler's Tale is capable of making a good Lego game for the handheld.  Look at the first Lego Batman game on the PSP, it is graphically and gameplay wise superior to the Vita version.  How can that be?

With all this complaining, why am I giving 3 stars?  Well, even as a 3DS version, I still found the game to be fun.  Even as a water downed version, I played it numerous hours on my commute to/from work.  I managed to get Platinum for this game, and I don't have many Platinums.  I found it addicting trying to collect every brick, musical note and character.  Playing as Superman is so much fun.  In free play, he was always my character of choice (although playing as Superman makes the game super easy).  Other characters feel underutilized.  I wish that there was more for Green Lantern or Flash and others.  Instead, you get a specific lego piece that can only be unlocked by either Flash or Green Lantern (I then promptly switch back to Superman).  Same goes for the villains.  You will only need Lex Luther and Poison Ivy for specific puzzles, and won't need other villains to unlock anything.  You have many of the DC heroes and villains on hand (once unlocked), but you'll end up not playing as them.  On PS3 on the other hand, I utilized the other characters more frequently.  While part of me wanted to give a 1 star like the many reviewers here, I did find the game addicting and fun.

I've played many MMO's where you run around and hack 'n slash your way to a higher level with little actual skill involved in fighting or taking down your enemies.

After hearing about AOC's combat system where you can attack different parts of the body and do combo's etc I thought just maybe we finally have an MMO where the fighting really does take much skill...
Well I was dissapointed to say the least. Fighting in melee is not anything special, you press either 1, 2, or 3 depending on where your opponents shields are not, wooppeee! - in my opinion this is a lame attempt to make fighting interesting. Blocking and parrying are things I would like to see of more in MMO's but in AOC its better to rather spend your time just blatantly attacking your enemy than trying to get the timing of your parry's right, as a good parry doesn't give your character any advantage to attack your enemy or put them off balance.

I also played with the Demonologist and resorted to using mainly one spell from my arsenal all the way to lvl 20. This got really boring after a while and the uselessness of the 'pet' I could summon lead me to removing it from my quickbar.

With regard to the games graphics the environments are lovely but still look a bit behind todays cutting-edge graphics. The sound and music score are seamless and the music does a good job of providing the right atmosphere.

I found the game to be extremely stable running Windows Vista and my 8800GTS, performance was smooth with everything on high, however if I turned the BLOOM option on performance dropped considerably.

After leaving Tortage and reaching lvl 20 I have uninstalled Age of Conan. Why? The storyline was good but I really felt I was wasting my time running around killing monsters to get my 'next hit' by levelling up.

Do NOT buy this game if you're expecting a recreation of the original Goldeneye we all remember from the 90s. I have very fond memories of the original on the N64. Such as hating anybody who played as Odd Job.

Pros:
-James Bond. I don't have to say much more.
-Guns. There are a lot of them! Diversity of the weapons is cool.
-Art style. The graphics are what you'd expect from a James Bond game but they're beginning to look dated.
-Sound design. The sound is great, gunfire and music are top notch.
-Nods to the original Goldeneye. Some of the levels are similar to that of the original, except you play as the Daniel Craig James Bond (which I am a fan of.)
-Voice acting. It sounds like they got Daniel Craig to voice Bond here, so I'm happy with that. The other voice actors are good as well. No shortage of Russians!
-Price. I found a copy of this for about $25 at my Gamestop last summer. Not a bad game for the price. Wouldn't spend much more on it, though.

Cons:
-Not a faithful recreation of the original. Although very similar in story, it's just not the same. I understand this is supposed to be a reboot, but it's not something you'll want to play if you're a frequent wearer of tight-fitting nostalgia glasses.
-Level design feels rushed, and sometimes objectives are unclear. Fairly linear and boring levels.
-Difficulty. I'm not somebody who plays Call of Duty often, but I am a huge fan of first person shooters. The original Goldeneye's difficulty was rewarding, much like playing through a match online in Battlefield. It was just plain fun. However I found myself hard-pressed to continue levels, sometimes putting the game away for weeks at a time.
-Not a whole lot of multiplayer activity.
-AI. They're pretty dumb, I feel like I was in Tae Kwon Do class again, as a blackbelt sparring against beginners. AI don't even notice you half the time, even if you're in their field of vision. Come on, movie bad-guys aren't even that dumb!
-Checkpoint system. Do I need to explain?
-Too COD-like. The developers tried way too hard to make this game a mainstream-shooter with features that big budget titles like Call of Duty have. It doesn't fare too well.
-Too modern. I don't know, something like Goldeneye really needs to stay cheesy and retro, in all of it's N64 glory. They tried to make this game modern, way too hard.

Final verdict: Meh. Not bad, not good. Worth $25, wouldn't spend more though. Agent Under Fire, Nightfire, and the original Goldeneye, even, were far better games.

Because of this lacking manual AND not even being a complete release (you have to download campaign mode, download about 10 characters who cost $1-$2 each, no english audio, etc) this is definitely not worth $50, should've been a maximum of $40, other companies like NIS America release complete games at $50 that also come with bonus items like artbooks, soundtracks, and such so why Namco Bandai couldn't is beyond me.

Nice graphics & music, they got alot of the details down from the manga down, stage gimmicks are a cool addition, great job with story mode, & you get a nice roster of 30+ characters with their own unique taunts & fabulous poses from 7 of the 8 parts + a wide array of unlockables among other features this game has to offer.

However I also had a few other complaints with the game itself. *Why are there invisible walls in stages? We aren't in the PS2/Gamecube/Xbox era anymore games these days allow you to explore every last nook & cranny of a stage, for example i'm fighting on the train station stage & i'm still a good 5-10 feet away from the train & can't go towards the edge all the way because the invisible wall is blocking my way, this is even worse in the steel ball run stage because it deceives you by looking like a vastly open field.
*You obtain no rewards from winning in arcade mode.*The characters speaking on the menu's gets pretty annoying/repetitious after a while telling you what you are planning to select, i'd rather hear nothing else but the background music playing like in every other fighting game made *Gameplay is a little too simplistic, depending on which character you choose you can get by a fight by mashing the square button over & over, mashing the square button a certain amount of times will also have you do a special move & when your energy meter at the bottom of the screen reaches 2 you just push the L1 button to do another special, there's not much of a learning curve here. *These next 3 bits are probably more so minor complaints/nitpicks, but why is it that the characters practically stand a whole football field apart from each other at the start of a battle? This comes in handy for select Phantom Blood & Battle Tendency characters who get to charge up their hamon, but completely pointless for the other 2/3's of the characters, Evasion is very weird, you push x to move to the side, but if your character is up against a wall then you need to press up or down on the d pad or nub to evade/move in the other direction & then can resume pressing x, And blocking makes no sense, in other fighting games when you press the block button it blocks an attack from any distance, but here if you're too close to an opponent you get hit regardless, you actually have to be a certain distance away from them in order for a block to work.

Hardcore JoJo fans should give this a look, you will probably look past the flaws that i've mentioned above, it is definitely worth playing if you love the series, but if you're just a general gamer or someone who has never experienced JJBA before, start off at the vastly anime or manga first or give the oldschool 2d fighter on dc & ps1 a try.",Decent enough game for a great anime & manga series.,1404950400,3,{'Color:': ' Playstation 3'},

I do not like how they only have one fighting style and a weapon style. So you can't really do any combos that change from one fighting style to another. Another thing I don't like is that you can only create one character per profile, unlike the wrestling CAW's. The konquest mode, in my opinion was pretty weak. First, they producers said there would be 2 modes- a good, and an evil. It is neat, however, how Taven fights in the konquest mode, but you fight people every other second, and you really cannot explore. What happened to the Chaos realm? Orderrealm? You don't see much of the realms at all, and my favorite part of Deception was the fact that you could explore all kinds of stuff, meditate and get secret things, talk to people and do side missions. It feels as though they rushed this game a tad.

I'm not saying it is a bad game, by no means, because it's not- I'm just saying, in my opinion, it's not as good as Deception. And why is Blaze all of a sudden the main character and a giant monster? Cool, yes, but it's kind of odd that they chose Blaze. To be honest, the story mode is a tad confusing. It almost seems like they are trying to cram way way too much into it, but without dedicating a lot of time to the story mode.

Also, I don't like how you cannot do wagers in versus battle. So, basically, you have to complete the konquest mode multiple times or do the arcade a lot to get koins to create a fighter. I'm not a fan of the krypt, either. They made a huge fuss about how they wanted it to be called the Vault.

And, just like with Deception, they promised to have ripped clothing etc. when you fight in the arcade, and yet again they failed to do so.

I know they took a chance with fatalities, and that's ok, but I think I speak for a lot of people when I say they are pretty weak fatalities. I mean, most of the fatalities in the last 3 games weren't too great and didn't seem to have a lot of thought put into them.

Overall, there are a lot of cool things in the game, but more disappointing things, especially when they claim it's the mother of all MK games.

This game involves flying combat missions to attack air and ground targets. You begin by leaving an airbase and crossing a map of the region to get to your intended mission.  However before you can actually fly the assigned mission, you must complete several ""mini-missions"" that might involve a dogfight with one or two aircraft and an attack on some ground targets. And in many cases, you will have to fight these EXACT SAME battles over and over each time you pass through an area. This becomes very repetitive very fast, and thus very tiresome.

3.0,False,"02 21, 2016",AN81JUYW2SL24,B015WCV6QM,Lord Otter,"I had the original Diamondback back in January of 2006. It replaced a Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer where the left button broke, and in games like Rainbow Six 3, I would get double taps from my Sig P226... which was awesome. In multiplayer games, my P226 would work like an automatic and other people would claim I was cheating. Anyhow, the Diamondback took it over for gaming purposes and I kept using it for the longest time until it was replaced by a Logitech G9x. I can't even find my Diamondback.

The new Diamondback has the same overall shape. I still remember it because my hands are always a tad too big for the Diamondback and I need to use the claw position. I wear size Medium/Large gloves, so its not like my hands are huge. The side buttons on this Diamondback are easy to accidentally press. The wheel has changed though. The old Diamondback scroll wheel was smooth. The new one has a ribbed texture running down the center that feels like I am stroking the back of an Alligator while scrolling. The left and right mouse buttons are extremely responsive and easy to rapidly click, which are perfect for gaming.

The default Chroma pattern is a rainbow that runs anti-clockwise. The colors flow on the strips in an anti-clockwise pattern and the snake or wheel button lights up in sequence. I prefer this sequence because it gives all of the colors a workout, and because it looks cool on my desk in the dark.

The Razer Synapse software is extremely intrusive. It required me to create an account, and then proceeded to update it software for the next several minutes which interfered with my Logitech keyboard and other USB devices, and then had to restart my computer. I despise these new software ""drivers"" that rob precious memory and CPU resources, especially something so intrusive or outdated that it requires me to reboot.

Overall: 3/5 stars. Why only 3 stars? They didn't bother to change the size or shape after all these years. I love the Logitech G series of mice because of their size and shape which fits my hands better. The original Diamondback was tiny and they kept the same size and shape. If they made the rear of the mouse (the part that faces the gamer) wider, it would be a lot better in my opinion. But other than that, this mouse is good to go as a gaming mouse - albeit a tad expensive. I also didn't appreciate having to load their software as I explained above.","Same shape/size as the original which is too small for my hands, cool Chroma lighting, ultra tactile buttons!",1456012800,,,

""X-Men:ROP"" is indeed done in the same style as the afore mentioned classic, but suffers from a case of flaw-itis.  What are those flaws...well I'll tell you.  First off play control is a bit awkward and a bit slow.  The jump button is the right hand trigger, and for big hands that isn't always easy(trust me).  Your X-men also doesn't like to be bothered to run, they crawl.  Rouge has some great animation, but she needs to haul it.  There is a dash move but enemies will hit you if you try to use it to escape.  Enemies will crowd around you. and since there is no defense you're toast.  Not to mention the fact that they can attack you during your attack, making it sometimes impossible to advance in the game.  The sound is terrible.  Tiny punches and ""arrgghh"" when you die.  Bosses don't make any flashy entrances, and they all have the same voice.  Given Game Boy Advances sound potential..someone messed up.  The bosses you encounter are unlocked once you beat them.  You can use them to fight a la street fighter, but you can't fight the CPU.  They are only available via the gamelink.  Great marketing, poor programing.

Said that, I have to admit this game's graphics details and image processing are extremely good and fast, but as we all know, this is not only what makes a game great. Don't take me wrong, the originality of the story and the moves you get are very pleasing, making you believe that this is going to entertain you forever. Sadly, this was not the case. I had many pressures from a good friend of mine who reviewed it to me as a true prodigy, and that I would never regret I've got it. But after a few hours, I felt like playing the same thing over and over again, with no much change of what you have to accomplish. I think what really drags you in is indeed the overall look and realism, but that cannot be the only thing which makes me enjoy the game as the first time.

 Far from being ""perfect"", as some reviewers wrote, this ""Assassin's Creed"" needs improvements in the next (?) chapter, such as more moves, more weapons, and a wider variety of missions to accomplish as the story goes along.

I have tried contacting Mad Catz directly via email on three separate occassions. Each time I received an automated response that my message was received and they would respond in a timely fashion. Evidently their version of timely and mine are vastly different as it has now been over three weeks.

For the most part this controller is exactly like the Call of Duty branded controllers. Actual functions though I can't say. It's disappointing that I couldn't get the controller to work.

I think in most gaming circles Mad Catz is synonymous with poor quality and short life span of their products.

Based on my experience with this product I would have to agree with those sentiments.

Edit:

After this review was up on Amazon for about 3-4 days I received an email from a Michael Browning - Technical Customer Support Supervisor - from MadCatz. He asked the issues I had with the controller and determined it was defective so he rushed me a replacement controller. The replacement arrived in short order and I again set about to test the controller.

I played a couple different games with it: Deus Ex, Call of Duty: Black Ops, Fear 3, Bulletstorm, and Dead Island.

The first thing I noticed was the actual feel of the controller. It has rubber grips along the side and a different type of matte finish than a normal Xbox controller. In this aspect, it is much better that the typical Xbox controller.

Next, the analog sticks were rather responsive and these two also seem to be a step up from a traditional Xbox controller. My thumbs seem to sit in them easier and allowed for quicker movements.

The X,Y,A,B buttons are right on par with the normal controller. Nothing new to report there.

The LB and RB were the same as well. I did notice a little different in the Left Trigger while playing Deus Ex. It seemed a little finicky at times but I am chalking it up to being new out of the box and not sompletely broken in yet, as the other games I play afterwards I had no issues like that.

The big feature of this controller is the custom mapping buttons on the underside of the controller. You can use these buttons for LB,A,B on the left underside and RB, X, Y on the right underside. When I first saw this I was intrigued but after playing around with it for awhile across different games I realized one thing. It's a good idea, but the buttons are misplaced. If I was to design this controller I would have moved those custom map buttons lower on the controller. Near where the screws are. Where they are placed now makes hitting them seem more awkward than useful to me.

The last thing I will point out is voice chat.

I use a Turtle Beach PX5 headset and when I was using this controller two people in my party said I sounded different and further away. They also sounded slightly different to me. There was a certain ""tin' sound in there voices. It wasn't so much as to be a distraction or affect voice quality, but it was just enough of a nuisance that it was noticeable almost the entire night.

Amazon does not allow me to redo the actual ""Star"" rating of this review which is unfortunate. If I was able to I would have changed the star rating to about a 3.5. It's a good controller, but I would have changed just a few things to make it a great controller. Thanks to Mad Catz for replacing my defective one with no issues. Much appreciated.",Hard to review a defective product,1314144000,2,,

Same sort of concepts with managing a large empire over several planets, but its just more intuitive and easier than Rebellion (especially the space combat).  The campaigns are good and fun.  The space skirmishes are fun, but the ground ones just aren't my thing.  I don't know if I'm just not getting it or what, but they last forever as I slowing grind into their base to destroy the enemies buildings.

The galactic conquest skirmishes are interesting, but can be a little overwhelming.  Essentially, you select the map you want to play on and then control on the planets, build fleets, etc. the same way you would in the campaign.  Its okay, but like I said, it can be overwhelming when you start with a dozen planets spread across the galaxy and have to build up their infrastructure and defend them.

In regards to the expansion, I thought the pirates or whatever, where way overpowered.  They might have changed this with a patch or something since I last played it, but seriously they were way to powerful in space.  The campaign for the expansion is strictly focused on the pirates, you don't have the option to play as the Rebellion or the Empire.

The much vaunted story (it's really very average-with zero surprises), the characterization (one dimensional), and the overall look and feel of the game were rather underwhelming, but it did have heart. Plus that ""Boom Boom Boom"" commercial was pure genius. If only  that was the game we ended up getting.
I think the biggest problem for me was the game trying to be all things to all people: a stealth game; an 'old school' shooter; a 'band of brothers' style survival tale; a reboot, and then failing to do justice to those elements. The stealth is clunky, the shooting feels floaty and imprecise, and the story comes and goes. It wants to be Bioshock, but lacks that games sense of mystery (not that Bioshock has held up all that well in my opinion). As an old school shooter, it rarely manages to sustain the type of manic intensity found in more recent games like Bulletstorm, Darkness 2 and even Killzone 3. It's stop/start gameplay that could have benefited from more enemies, and larger arenas. Hell, even the moon feels small here.

Which brings me to my final point. The sense of scale the game tries so hard to convey, is missing. No matter where you go (and you go to a lot of places), you always end up in drab, dreary environments. There are exceptions, but overall it didn't matter where I was, the moon, Gibraltar, London, the trip never felt quite as epic as perhaps it should have.

I'm also a fan of Disney, and I wanted a Nintendo DS game that was Disney-themed to play while in line at Disney theme parks for a recent trip.  Enter Meteos: Disney Magic.

I'd never played Meteos before.  I can say now that I understand how to play, but I played all the way through easy and normal without having a clue of what I was supposed to be doing aside from matching blocks in a Bejeweled block-swapping way.  The instructions, both in-game and booklet, are not that helpful.  I'm not sure if this is because they assume you've played Meteos before or because Meteos just doesn't give good instructions.

So, for anyone considering this game who, like me, hasn't played the original Meteos, this is what the game is:
1) You can move any unlocked block horizontally or vertically within its group of blocks (not across empty spaces) any number of spaces.
2) If you match 3 or more blocks, those blocks and everything above them will fly up.  The blocks that matched turn into a ""locked"" state (and look like a platform, kind of).  You can't move the blocks that matched, but you can move other blocks through them.
3) When the matched blocks fly up, any blocks (whether they're the ones you matched or not) that cross the top of the screen will disappear and presumably get added to your score.
4) Gravity is in effect, in varying levels.  So, on some boards, it will take 3-4 launches to get a pile of ten blocks over the top line.  On other boards, it will take 2.  Vertical matches seem to launch better than horizontal matches, but vertical matches also generally carry less for you, even on a full column.  (The varying gravity and launch effects are really what make each board unique and fun.)
5) The board ends either when you meet the goal (success) or when any column of blocks becomes so tall that a block that falls on top of it falls off the screen (fail).  (Columns in this state flash to warn you; you don't actually lose until a random block falls on that column, but you can't see when that is going to happen.)

Sounds simple, right?  Well, there's some further ambiguity.  The goals on each level are things like: launch 500 blocks, launch 100 specific blocks.  But, it's never clear what ""launch"" is.  Is launch getting them above the top line?  Or is launch making them into a match set so that they fly up? If it's getting them above the top line, do ones that I match that turn into the temporary ""locked"" state count or not? Sadly, I'm not meticulous enough to count them and get the answer to my question, and the rules are no help here.  It's this kind of thing that continues to frustrate me.  I even tried googling for ""Meteos rules"" and ""Meteos tips"" but I had no luck.  Most people on the internet want to talk about the varying gravity on the levels rather than the goals.  Again, I don't know if this is because the goals are unique to the Disney version or if it's just something Meteos players all know before they buy this game.

One other frustration point is that the game does not self-pause or go into standby if the DS is closed.  That is, if you're in the middle of a level and have to close the DS, you have to remember to hit the pause key and THEN close the DS.  Otherwise, the game goes on even with the DS closed.  (It will also kill your battery for you.)  This is REALLY annoying, and it's a basic expectation of a DS game.  That's just lazy programming, to not properly consume the close event.

That problem becomes particularly bothersome when you realize that the game doesn't save your progress!  Each difficulty level in story mode (the main game mode) consists of a series of boards, anywhere from 4-12 depending on difficulty, I think.  You have to play through the WHOLE difficulty level in one sitting.  You can't leave it and come back to it later.  You can't even just pause and close the DS because it will keep the screen on and suck your battery while it's closed.  I can just see the argument between a parent and child, ""But MOM, if I stop now, I have to START ALL OVER and I'm almost through difficult!""  Again, I feel that this is lazy programming.  It does not add to game play.

Now, you may wonder why, given all my complaints and frustrations, I'm still giving this game 4 stars for fun and 3 stars overall.  It is a very fun game.  I wouldn't have had these frustrations if it hadn't sucked me in and had me playing it often.  I love the Disney theming.  They did a great job incorporating the characters into the Meteos game, and I really like watching the Disney animations.  Also, there's even some logic to the gravity/launch effects; they make sense with the character in use.  Also, the gravity/launch effects are consistent for each character.  A Pirates-themed board behaves the same in terms of gravity/launch no matter where you encounter it or what the goal is.  The gameplay does start feeling repetitive, and I think there's something bad about being able to play through as much of the game as I have, without really understanding it fully.  There have been times when I've cleared levels without thinking, just randomly scooting blocks around, almost scribbling on my DS screen.  (That's pleasurable, too, in its own way.)

Overall, I recommend the game, but the problems I mention are something to consider.  If you're giving this as a gift, you might want to give the person a primer on Meteos, too, and warn them about the lid-closing, lest they kill their battery unexpectedly.","Fun game with great Disney theming, but has some hampering usability flaws",1232668800,4,,
3.0,True,"05 1, 2016",A1G7SBE1W49DNS,B00ZRZTT3W,BRIAN SOLOW,"My review of Star Fox Zero & Guard

Part 1 Star Fox Zero

Pros

Fast pace arcade feel - Thanks to Platinum Games the game not only retains its arcade feel to but also has Platinum style in as being a fast pace action game.

Good Amiibo support - Like last year Mario Maker you do have the ability to unlock new arwings (the Black and the Retro Awring) in Star Fox Zero however if for some reason you don't have the Falco or Fox Amiibo don't worry you can still unlock them the old fashion way (by collecting 70 medals in the game)

Love the new vehicles - Beside returning vehicles like the Landmaster (which control better then it did in Star Fox Assault) 2 new vehicles are added. I love the new Walker and would love to see it be used in future Star Fox games and I did enjoyed using the Gyrowing (which I found easy to use despite the odd control scheme in Star Fox Zero).

its playable - Probably the most controversial part of Star Fox Zero is the controls. However there are way to make the experience better. By have the motion control come on only when you tap the fire button (ZR) and pressing the select button to switch to cockpit I found it to help make the game more enjoyable (at least that how I see it)

Cons

Little to no replay value - Outside of collect medals (That unlock challenge mission) and unlocking the sound tests there really isn't much to do. No online leaderboard (You can post your high score on miiverse but that it) or any form of multiplayer (offline or online)

The Controls - As I said early Star Fox Zero is playable but not easy to used thanks to Nintendo decision to force the motion controls and the screen on the gamepad. This make playing Star Fox Zero very difficult and there are times you will get frustrated with the controls. It would have been nice if Nintendo had at least give us a traditional control scheme for those who don't want to used the motion control or the 2nd screen. I feel as though Nintendo was so desperate for the gamepad to be used for something in Star Fox Zero (Then again Nintendo really didn't do a good job selling the gamepad in the first place).

Part 2 Star Fox Guard

Pro

Good uses of the Gamepad - Unlike Star Fox Zero Star Fox Guard actually used the gamepad the right way (like Mario Maker did). Basically you tap (or move before or during battle) on the camera on the gamepad and you move the camera with the right analog stick and shoot with fire button (ZR). The TV screen act as your security camera while the gamepad screen act as your map to show where the enemies are.

Very Challenging - While the game starts off a bit easy the difficultly does pick up in later levels which to me is a good thing plus with different types of enemies (and different of cameras to used) the game encourages to take different approach to defeat certain enemies.

Fun online multiplayer - Similar to Mario Maker the game lets your make your own maps (or your own robot army) and challenging others players online.

Cons

Ok amiibo used - While not exactly bad the amilbo support isn't great either. Basically you used scan the Fox & Falco amiibo before each mission and and during each mission you can call in a squard of arwings to help you. Its ok but I do wish there was an option where you can used the metal (in currency) to call in a arwing air strike rather then having to scan the amiibo every time. Plus the feature can only be use once a day and cant be uses in certain mission.

Overall - Star Fox Zero for me is a mix bag for me. On one hand the game is a return to what make Star Fox 64 a great game.

The Bad: Cumbersome and sluggish combat, only 6 levels, characters aren't as interesting as they could have been, not much reason to go back

Most of the time when a sexy protagonist is on the front cover you know you're in for a bad game. Lollipop Chainsaw is actually quite enjoyable if you look past the flaws. You play as the sexy cheerleader Juliet Starling who is part of a zombie hunting family. You must stop a goth kid from turning everyone in your high school and town into zombies. The story is pretty thin and not very interesting because the game isn't even long enough to dish out a meaty story. With only 6 levels you're looking at a weekend rental at best. With this being a Suda 51 game you can also expect crazy out the you-know-what. The game is oozing with style and visual eye candy, but is it any good?

The answer is yet, but with flaws. The first issue is the combat. There are plenty of combos you can buy and unlock at chop2shop.com stations. You can buy health and other items like art, threads, and music. Once you start unlocking more combos the game is more diverse, but Juliet doesn't feel like the limber cheerleader she should be. Basic attacks use her pom-poms, but it takes forever to make a zombie groggy enough for a chainsaw kill. I rarely used basic attacks and just stuck to chainsaw attacks. Her chainsaw is cumbersome, and the combat system in general needs more polish. I felt like I was controlling a giant fat guy rather than a nimble girl. Her animations are too long and you get constantly knocked back which means tapping B to recover every time. The combat is just sluggish and not as limber as games like Tomb Raider or Bayonetta.

The combat is even flawed with the chainsaw blaster. Aiming the thing is a pain because it always sticks to enemies like there's a magnet. I can't go for precise headshots or aim at barrels. You can use Nick Tickets which are special mini-games that use Nick's head (her headless boyfriend) as a weapon. These are pretty crazy and funny like shooting his head out of a cone like a topper or swinging him around on a rope among others. You can use your rainbow power to become invincible for a while and start sparkle hunting. If you kill three or more zombies in a row you will a trippy girly pose scene of Juliet and earn bonus coins.

The combat is obviously the main focus because there's not much else here. There are a few mini-games like pole dancing, jumping on zombie heads, and the few mini-games that are level specific, as well as a few chainsaw dash areas. The 6 levels are interesting and keep things mixed up, but it's the bosses that are all different and interesting. Each one has some sort of musical skill from a different genre of music. Having to kill them is awesome and full of gore and guts which you will see plenty of.

Lastly, the graphics are not technically impressive, but have lots of visual flair. The blood from zombies flows pink with rainbows, sparkles, and stars flying out. The game is very girly, but appeals to men due to the sex appeal and violence. Juliet herself is hard to like and is not as memorable as other females like Lara Croft or Bayonetta. She's a dingy preppy cheerleader and is the exact stereotype of one. Nick says funnier things than she does, but the sayings just get repetitive and annoying after awhile. Juliet is hard to like because she acts dumb, and is weak and selfish personality wise. The game just isn't long enough to flesh out the characters and story more.

After you beat the game there's no reason to back except for ranking mode to beat scores and unlock new stuff. The game has a lot of potential, but needs some more polish before it can sit among the action/adventure kings like God of War, Tomb Raider, and Bayonetta. The combat is sluggish and cumbersome, the game is short, and the characters aren't developed as well as they could have been. There is tons of visual flair, but the game is lacking technically with some low resolution textures and poor lighting effects.

One of the included games was Backyard Wrestling 2:  There Goes The Neighborhood.  Though I didn't hear sterling reviews from the game, I decided to pick it up anyway because, for that price, I was going to be at least entertained by one of the games.

Short synopsis:  Influenced by equal parts deathmatch wrestling and musical styles favored by fans of horrorcore, BW2 blends beat-em-up, fighting, and wrestling genre games into one title for people who may be fans of any of the above.  Wrestlers from Combat Zone Wrestling, Big Japan Wrestling, Juggalo Championship Wrestling, and the defunct-Xtreme Pro Wrestling (in addition to a few freelance wrestlers) tear it up alongside a bevy of adult film actresses.  The action takes place in a backyard or backstage style of setting.  The object of the game is to win the match against your opponent by pinfall, submission, or knockout.  In addition to an exhibition modes were two players may challenge each other, the game has a career mode for one to take their created wrestler through as they complete missions and challenges to unlock additional stages, videos, and accessories for their customized wrestler.  Beat the career mode and you'll have access to all of the hidden goodies the game has.

What I liked about the game was that the roster, soundtrack, career mode, and relatively easy learning curve of the game.  The roster featured a bunch of wrestlers that no other wrestling title would've allowed me to play as (unless you find a way to customize said wrestlers in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fire-Pro-Wrestling-Returns/dp/B00GGUE1KS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fire Pro Wrestling Returns</a>.)  Wanna have a Zandig Vs. Ito showdown?  Have at it.  Wanna see Vampiro go toe-to-toe with Ruckus?  Have fun.  Ever wondered what a Tylene Buck Vs Kitana Baker tilt would look like?  Well wonder no more.  In addition, the soundtrack consists of Body Count, Andrew WK, Every Time I Die, Kool Keith, Vision of Disorder,  Mudvayne, Clutch, Gwar, and ICP (amongst many, many others.)  It may show my age a little over the fact that I find them exciting over the constant EDM nonsense that plays nowadays, but that's perhaps one of my favorite soundtracks compiled for a game outside of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NHL-2K9/dp/B001B0BB4M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NHL 2K9</a>.  The career mode was uncomplicated (which was refreshing, actually) and had you face off against jobbers en route to facing off against the established wrestlers.  And if you hadn't played the game before, you don't need to learn any complicated button commands to get the hang of the gameplay.

What I didn't care for was the lack of game options and relatively limited options in the create-a-wrestler.  Every match was strictly one-on-one, so there's no way to see ICP team up to take on all comers.  Perhaps a three-way match may have been a bit complicated, but a two-on-two bedlam or battle royale option could've been included (and though it technically stayed true to it's namesake, a training ring or arena level in the confines of a ring would've been welcome.)  Further, the create-a-wrestler isn't extraordinarily deep.  Your finisher is based off of one of the main characters instead of having one you can call your own, which kinda stinks.  Also, your created wrestler shows up as ""Player 1"" in the HUD, which is silly when you consider other games were capable of doing this well beforehand (and on lesser systems.)

People expecting a true-to-life wrestling game may be disappointed, but people who ever wondered what it would be like to apply wrestling rules to a beat-em-up game may be surprised by how much they enjoy the title.  Though not perfect, I view Backyard Wrestling 2 to be to the beat-em-up genre what&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saturday-Night-Slam-Masters/dp/B000J3N2L2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saturday Night Slam Masters</a>&nbsp;was to the fighting genre.

Five years ago my son decided to start watching it as well and has grown to love it just as much as me.  We know the TV version pretty much inside and out.  So when we got him a DS for Christmas, this game was a given.  While the idea is good, the execution isn't the greatest.

1) There are only four avatars available and none of them fit your average, every day, middle aged female.  One is crazed looking and the other about 80.  I can not imagine they couldn't have come up with at least a couple of more options.

2) The game moves very slowly.  There are pauses between every action.  The screen shots of the prizes are grainy and gives it a low budget look and feel.

3) The game flow really doesn't make sense.  Why should you get to play a pricing game if you loose in contestant row?  If you're playing multiplayer, why do both get to the show case when only one can win at the big wheel?  I understand there has to be some modifications, but these do not seem to make a lot of sense.  Basically you win, whether you win or not.

4) I wish there was an option to toggle the instructions on how to play the pricing games.  a) those who have watched the show are already going to know and b) after you've played the game a few times, it's easy to remember the instructions.  No need to continue repeating them over and over again.  At least enable the user to tap the screen to speed up the process.

5) I'm not sure where they got their pricing, but I tend to think some of them are a little low.  I had a show case with a car, grill, and another item.  All total it was less than 14,000.  Makes you wonder if it was a used car.....

6) This one is for those that know the TV show.  The person with the highest winning total stands on the right in the showcases, not the left.  Not a big deal, but shows a lack of attention to details and something that could have easily been corrected.

7) Limited game play due to the lack of games available and the ease of memorizing prices.  It lacks enough variety to be a game that gets a ton of time.

Overall it is a great game but gets bogged down in boring quests where  you run around endlessly chasing people down to ask questions or back and forth doing things to make the quest longer but really, it becomes tiresome and tedious, so much so that I had to stop playing because I was that bored with the quests. The writing in and of itself is quite good but how the quests are designed is pretty dull. I felt this way about witcher 1 at certain points but Witcher 2 seemed to improve upon that so I was quite hopeful for this one.

The open world is well done on one level but it's rather boring after a certain point given that all the locations for the most part are simply bandits or something along those lines. A few differ but not much. When I see an open world like this I compare it to skyrim because they set the bar. Here, we could have used more interesting places to explore rather than locations where you just discover bandits or light weight treasure or if you are lucky a few monsters to kill.

This game has the least amount of combat of any game that I can remember playing to date. Most of it is actually toward the end and the quests do not really include it. Many of them are designed with you specifically running around from place to place. I spent a few hours just doing that today. I got so bored  I grabbed a witcher quest from a notice board to at least kill something. And  that is where this game really fails the most. Had they stuck to the same style but shortened things so it was more reasonable (like you have to chase down three instead of five of Dandelion's women) that would have been far more tolerable. But they take an idea and make it tedious rather than keeping it within the bounds of reason. This is true for more than a few of the main quests. The running around from place to place and moreso in a city that feels overly large to have you running all over it, well, it's just not really done  that well and I understand why people have said that they found it boring.

I finished it once and wanted to finish it again because like I said, it has its merits. The downside is that slogging  through some of these quests is pretty tedious. I wish they had written it with some idea of how to keep things concise and interesting rather than dragging them on. Or perhaps so that if you didn't want to do the list of ten things you could do two or three and that would be enough.

I give Syberia II four stars* for its graphics and production values, but for gameplay I'd rate it a three or maybe even a two. The reason I decided to give it four stars is because it actually is a pretty good game if you enjoy third-person adventure games. For some reason, I keep buying them (starting with Syberia, then The Longest Journey, then The Black Mirror) and I keep hating them. I felt compelled to play this in order to finish the Syberia story, but I still didn't really enjoy it.

I prefer the first-person adventure games where there is no character interaction, no dialogue, no inventory, and the puzzles are focused on pure logic. Third-person adventures, including Syberia, utilize an immense amount of conversation and always (that I've seen) include weird and illogical use of an inventory. I don't enjoy these gameplay elements. I feel that they doom third-person adventures to always have the same elements: constantly running around talking to people, doing something, having to go back and talk to them again, and putting inventory items together in strange ways.

So what's the point of this rant? Only to say that Syberia, for all its production values, still falls victim to this lousy gameplay. But as long as you enjoy that type of game, then Syberia II is one of the best. Just know what you are getting into before you buy it. I'm trying to be fair and objective with my star rating, because I know that at the core this is one of the better adventure games out there -- it's just not the kind that I like.

EDIT: Well, I just hit the ""Save"" button for this review and it turns out you can't edit your star rating once you've done that. On second thought, I think I might even drop my rating down to three stars. Great graphics can't excuse poor gameplay.

* As it turns out, I am now able to edit my star rating. I have left the review as it was originally written, but I have changed the star rating from 4 stars to 3 stars, as I had intended after first publishing it.",Good only if you like this type of game,1136764800,2,,

3.0,True,"08 29, 2016",AATG3F3SSUQDX,B00IR8D35Q,Luis DLC,"Yep, it is long review, it should be a very useful one too:

I own 2 Nerf armors, for 3DS XL systems. They were both just PERFECT so I bought this one blindly.

Most complains (among the ones that make sense, that is) are because the armor does not fit snugly. And some complains are because it does not fit at all and it acts like a plate where the 2DS is like a loaf that will fall off should you turn the plate upside down.

Mine holds the 2DS in place, but when the (abyx) buttons are pressed it will ""click"" on that side and come up on the left side, and when pressing the digital cross (+) the same happens, and the right side comes up. That is enough to render it unusable for me, but some more tolerant people (my wife for instance) find it OK.

But since this is for our kid, I didn't want to risk it.

So here's how to fix it:
You need double sided tape. Avoid thick ones (like wall mounting and the like) you'll need thin clear plastic double sided tape (Yellow scotch is probably the easiest to find) and the 2 cm width is preferable but you can make any size work. You need to apply tape to the left and right sides (of the inside, of course) avoiding the holes, even the very little dot like indentations for the 2DS point like ""feet"". For imperfections like the one I had to deal with, tape on the sides is enough. If the one you get is like a plate that does not ""click"" at all, try carpeting the whole bottom with the tape.

Mine is perfect after the treatment. And the good thing is that, if needed, you can easily undo it.

Minus Stars on the rating:
1. It didn't fit as it should. As the others do for the other Nintendo systems. It is the same brand, and the same technology. Unexcusable.
2. It is not cheap. This things must be costing Nerf something like 10 cents per unit, from the Chinese factories. If I am paying more than 20 bucks, I surely expect quality. If they were like 10 bucks I would probably give 4 stars and excuse the lack of precision with a ""meh"" price tag.

Plus Stars on the rating:
1. It is good quality material. The problem here is one of precision on the design, but the thing is made of very good materials.
2. Other than point 1: Design is very good. All holes and accesses are very accurate.
3. Durable, easy and comfortable to use: This includes the usability of getting it off the system if you ever need to check the unit's serial number or anything else. And the fact that even if you hold it for long periods of time it is very comfortable; The material does not get sticky or deteriorate with sweat or hands heat.

Absurd things people complain about this product:
1. We couldn't choose the color: That is *ahem* was Amazon's fault and it's been fixed (I chose mine's color); Not the product's fault. That complain does not belong on a product's review. There is a shipper and a seller (when applicable) review. And Amazon is reasonable enough to fix this kind of thing.
2. It does not protect the screens: OFF COURSE NOT!!! That is clear just by looking at the pictures of the product! That is something this product has never intended to do. It is just not designed that way. It does not do it for the other Nintendo systems either! If you drop a foldable 3DS when it is unfolded there is absolutely no screen protection. This I find a very outrageous and crazy complain. If you wanted to protect the screens you are simply looking at the wrong product.
3. It damaged the L / R buttons: While this armor CAN INDEED DO THAT (by getting stuck on those buttons if the 2DS slides downwards and off the armor), what I find absurd is the circumstances: If it didn't fit properly in the first place, instead of sending back the product or trying to fix it, you anyways leave it on the 2DS and throw the whole thing naked (as in without a carrying case) into a bag. I am sure this thing is not going to pry the buttons off while you are using the system. It was carelessly thrown inside a bag, and then when the screen comes out broken or the buttons have been damaged, the armor is to blame. Sure.

3.0,False,"11 29, 2004",A3TTSOJM3X1U8S,B00029QR8I,Jasmine T. Baer,"Bottom line up front:  After 15 years, Pirates! is updated, and just about the only improvement is in the graphics.  Just about everything is the same as the original - for better or for worse.  It would be akin to Ford releasing the Mustang in 1964, keeping the same body style for a couple of more years, and not producing any Mustangs until 2005.  Then, to top it off, Ford releases a Mustang in 2005 that has a 1964-era suspension, bias-ply whitewalls, and vinyl seats - but, it has some nice new colors!  Would it still be fun to drive?  Yes.  But after all that time, wouldn't buyers expect more improvement?  This buyer certainly would!

Sid Meier's Pirates! is a game that allows players to become a swashbuckling pirate in the mid- to late-seventeenth century Caribbean.  This new version is an update to the original smash hit of about 15 years ago.  You'd have thought that after 15 years they could have added a little more depth to the characters, but more on that later.

To summarize for those unfamiliar with the original, players control a pirate and they can sail around plundering ships and seizing the cargo and gold, or they can choose to try to make it big as a trader in goods such as luxury items, sugar, etc.  In between all the sailing and looting or trading, the pirate can align himself with one of four colonial powers (France, Spain, England, Holland), woo the daughter of any of the several colonial governors, gain information from a barmaid, bartender, or mysterious stranger in a tavern, upgrade/repair his ship or fleet of ships at the shipmaster's or trade goods with a merchant.

Let me not parse my words:  The real fun of this game is sailing, sea battles, and trying to find treasure, wanted criminals, or lost relatives.  All the other activities like wooing the governor's daughter, sneaking into an unfriendly town, interacting with the townspeople, and fighting duels is repetitive and time consuming.

There are several levels (I think five, but I don't have my manual with me now) of difficulty from which to choose.  So far, I've played only on the first two:  apprentice and journeyman.  It is pretty difficult to mess up on apprentice level - a player can completely ham and egg it in a battle and still manage to win.  Slight errors in judgement, timing, and aim will penalize a player more in journeyman level, but not so much as to make it too much harder than apprentice.  The increased difficulty has its rewards, though:  players get to keep a higher share of the booty as the level of difficulty is increased!

The game's interface is very easy to learn - everything is done via the number pad on the keyboard.  Players can also use the mouse to point and click their way around the Caribbean, but the number pad system is much faster and more accurate.

The player's pirate accumulates wealth, land (granted by colonial governors), special items (like balanced swords, dueling pistols, jewelry, etc.), finds lost relatives, captures criminals, defeats notorious pirates (like Cap'n Kidd), and finds buried treasure.  The success of the pirate at these activities determines his rankings upon his retirement.  He could end up as a governor, or a pick-pocket depending upon how successful he was during his career.  Retirement?!  Yep!  You can't be a pirate forever.  The pirate will actually age over time, and his reflexes and/or his charm will erode, which makes it harder to win duels, dance properly (when wooing the aforementioned governors' daughters), or put together a crew.  Although I have never had a pirate long enough to see him age, I presume that I can retire him before he embarrasses himself - unlike some boxers that I can think of.  Evander Holyfield, are you listening?

Things to like:

1.  Simplified gameplay makes it as intuitive as the original.

2.  Sailing around and plundering or trading.

3.  Gaining rank, wealth and land.

4.  Searching for lost relatives, criminals, or notorious pirates.

5.  Did I mention sailing around and plundering or trading?

Things that are not up to snuff:

1.  All the NPC-like characters (governors, barmaids, mysterious strangers, bartenders, motley crews) kind of look alike, depending on their nationality.

2.  Not surprisingly, the governors' daughters all look alike, too.  Some are ""plain,"" ""attractive,"" or ""beautiful.""  Amazingly, the beautiful ones also show as much cleavage as a Victoria Secrets model.

3.  No way to change how your pirate looks.  It would be nice to be able to make the pirate shorter, taller, thinner, fatter, uglier, balding, etc.  Heck, it would be nice to make the pirate a female.

4.  On the easier levels, it is possible to get a promotion from a colonial governor even though your pirate might have just sunk three of his nation's ships.  This may change at higher difficulty levels, but even at easier levels, this seems pretty weak.

5.  Pirate character development is pretty weak to non-existent.  No way to see how much a pirates' swordplay has been improved due to the fact that he has acquired the balanced swords special item.  Players are unable to choose the clothing of the pirate, etc.

6.  Scripted videos of vessel boarding, duelings, etc. are repetitive and mind-numbing after a while.

This is a very, very, fun, albeit shallow, game.  It would have been nice if developers had updated the game so that players could customize their pirates a lot more - think about Sims in Sims 2, your golfer in Tiger Woods 2005, or characters from Diablo II.  I mean, please try and take advantage of increased capabilites of the PC, people!!

It is a great game, the controls are slightly odd considering I was used to playing it with a regular PS1 controller but after a few hours I was pretty used to it. I will state however that the arcade games in the Golden Saucer we're near impossible to play without a controller but it was an enjoyable experience regardless.

Cloud saving with the provided servers is absolute garbage though. I have had my saves deleted multiple times causing me to restart. This is a major let down especially when you are doing everything you can in the game and have a lot of time invested only to have it just randomly disappear on you. Don't trust the cloud and save locally.

A word to the wise however that you cannot use the character booster except from the launch menu, and ONLY on a cloud save. That's right, the client will not allow you to use the booster on local save files. For some strange reason the characters and data are boosted on the FF7 website and then the data is sent to your client when the client is made to retrieve the files on the cloud.

Not that it makes a difference considering the ""Boost"" isn't much of a boost at all. It will only max out your gil and max out your health for the characters in the present party. This means you have to do the boost multiple times for different characters, which requires completely exiting the game and going back to the FF7 website to manually initiate the boost.

Throw in the fact that you won't get better potions until later in the game and it almost becomes pointless to have all that health when you can only heal 150 of it a time, or have to click 100 times to heal everyone after every fight in the pause menu.

The graphics are not HD as well, they only softened, so as to look smoother. Almost as if a matte finish was thrown over the entire game, the cut scenes also have a terrible vsync issue though that could be my native resolution.

I have bought every accessory and have been very pleased by all of them, including the wireless internet receiver and the HD-DVD drive.  The graphics in Gears of War look better than anything on any other system, PS3 included (which I also own).  However, despite taking the best care of my system and using it only once in a while, it has died with a hardware malfunction after only six months.  I have become a member of the ""Red Ring Of Death"", when three flashing portions of the console's Ring of Light denote that the hardware has failed.  Despite Microsoft's instructions and my best efforts, it would not work again.

The only thing that keeps me from cursing Microsoft's name is that they recently extended the warranty on the 360 from 90 days to one year, and that retroactively applies so that my console, purchased in late Spring of 2006, is now within warranty once again.  So after a call to Microsoft this past weekend they are sending me a pre-paid UPS package so I can ship my console to get fixed at  no charge.  I cannot say how disappointing it is to have a $400 machine, with $300 in extra components purchased, just up and stop working one day.  I think more and more people are experiencing this, which is why Microsoft has extended the warranty.  Otherwise they may be looking at a class action suit or very negative publicity, which is the last thing they need now that two other consoles have hit the market.

Anyway, if it is fixed and returns to working condition with no future problems, I will be happy.

It drives me crazy how a system with everything the PS3 boasts (outstanding graffix, HDMI, Blu Ray Player, etc), and it seems like there are only a couple great games for it. Ninja Gaiden is awesome, but the overall roster of games just flat out isn't getting it done. Maybe I just had too high of expectations, but PS3- exclusive titles seem to be disappearing as well. There have already been a couple games that were hyped to be great, but they turned out to be anything but great. Hopefully Sony will get things together soon.

Cons: There are no tutorials or levels, so everybody is just thrown into the dance and you just have to try and keep up.  If you are having difficulty doing a move there is no slowing it down, you just have to try and try again.  This is where Dance Central on XBox Kinect blows this game out of the water.  If you are going to be frustrated by not being able to learn all the dance moves properly I would suggest the other one.

My kids all seem to enjoy this one, and it doesn't really care if you are accurate or not, my four year old does not care what his score is, he just enjoys trying to do the moves.

I just wish they had the tutorials and the levels (easy, middle, advanced) that Dance Central has, it would make this a much better game.

I also like the Just Sweat section, you can set a goal of how many songs/calories per day and then you just dance to various songs of your choice until you meet that goal.

The R&C games have always been above all easy to pick up and fun to play.  Intuitive in the extreme.

This latest installment is WAY too complicated.  The story is too intricate, the new weapons and procedures are too difficult, and even the space navigation system is overly fussy and complex.  In particular, the recording system that Clank must use to proceed practically gives me a headache.

You know the game is off the mark right from the opening cut scene, a ponderous bunch of blather about time.

Of course, there continues to be plenty of humor, most emanating from the intergalactic goofball Captain Quark, but IMO Crack in Time falls far short of the exhilarating perfection of its immediate predecessor in the series, Tools of Destruction.

I hear that the next R&C title will be an online melee, which I will also pass on.  NOT interested.

Some have complained that the R&C games have become too formulaic, but there was NOTHING to complain about in TOD (except that I wish it had been longer), and I could happily play more adventures like that one for the rest of my life.

So -- I hope the developers get back to basics after they get their meleeing out of their system -- and return the R&C series to the intuitive and supremely enjoyable gameplay that TOD delivered in spades.

Those looking for the supreme R&C adventure should check out Tools of Destruction instead of Crack in Time.  It's the most fun you can have in life short of having sex, riding a great roller coaster, or eating a well-made brick-oven pizza with top-quality ingredients!

UPDATE: This is the first R&C game I've played that I'm not going to even try to complete...  The Clank recording sequences are simply unbearable.

Though all of these games fit the so-called ""first person shooter"" category, the difference in time is marked by the relative advances in graphics, sound and overall gameplay.  Unfortunately, because DF is the oldest, these weaknesses are most obvious in that game.  DF introduces the character of Kyle Katarn, a former Imperial Commando who went solo rather than torture captured rebel spy Jan Ors.  Not entirely won over by the rebel cause, Katarn nevertheless carries out certain high-priority, low-profile missions that require him to sneak and shoot (actually run and blast) his way into highly fortified areas.  In the opening mission, Kyle breaks into an imperial fortress to steal plans for the first Death Star, allowing Princess Leia to obtain them on her way home to Alderaan.  The meat of the story that forms the rest of the game has Kyle tracking down a new Imperial weapon - the ""Dark Trooper"", a sort of souped up version of the regular stromtroopers who've been dropping like flies since May of 1977.  When a rebel outpost is mysteriously wiped out, Kyle goes in to investigate.  Further levels send Kyle to other planets - ice planets, completely urbanized planets (Coruscsant is a stop), planets that appear to be all cliffs, and one planet where you spend a lot of time floating in a sewer (Anoat, which I think was the planet that Han and Leia decided not to go to in ""Empire""; despite what happened in Bespin, it was still a wise choice).  You also travel to Nar Shadaa (the floating city) get captured by Jaba the Hutt (you escape, but not with your weapons), and slink around various spaceships.  The story doesn't carry that well into the game - if not for cutscenes and mission briefs, you wouldn't know what the point of all the shooting was.  The missions themselves seem hodge-podge (you go to various planets to get clues about the new weapon and where it can be located, but little else links one level to another) but come together to form a more cohesive story by the end (the final levels are more closely linked, hinting of the climax).  Though a shooter, DF is also a puzzle game, requiring you to drop your blaster and think for a moment (the power to destroy a wave of stormtrooper is nothing compared to the power you'll need to reach the center of the maze they were guarding).
Time hasn't been kind to this game, and anybody raised on the likes of ""Quake 2"" or DF's own sequel, JK, will likely be appalled by its low-end graphics (this game is circa 1994, and has a minimum hardware req. of a 386!) and MIDI sound (which is similarly unkind to John Williams famous music).  What really kills it is how the game simulate the first-person perspective - there are separate controls for turning Kyle's head sideways AND for looking up and down.  That is problematic enough when having to deal with dangers above (probe droids and mind-probe droids) and below (the sewer monsters).  Combine that with the artificial feeling of Kyle's movements, and you'll feel like you're seeing the world less through his eyes and more through the windshield of a car he's driving (sustained gameplay reportedly induces nausea).  Nevertheless, the thinking-shooter's aspect of the game is more than enough to warrant a shot at this pre-modern game.  Those who complete the game and tire of its levels can download third-party levels designed by fans as well as mods (you can play Boba Fett).  If you are stuck with something lower than a 100 Mhz Pentium and will do anything short of buying one to get the Star Wars experience, this may be the game for you.","An oldie, but not neccessarily a baddie",1012780800,3,,

The over-the-shoulder perspective is now a staple in the action genre, plus the game was so well designed, it is one of the few games that keeps bringing me back after the initial sparkle wears off.

Resident Evil 5 borrows heavily from Resident Evil 4. Having said that, comparison is inevitable. And initially, it seems like more of the same good stuff. But is it really?

The first difference that's gonna hit you in the graphics. Yes. They're gorgeous. You will find yourself spending time in each level just marveling at the details and effects.

Along with the improved graphics, the combat is also sped up a little bit and the game is perfectly paced. The action is fast and fun, and brings back the Resident Evil 4 feel pretty well. The gameplay alone makes it worthy of a rental. Resident Evil 5 also introduces Co-op gameplay where a friend assumes the role of Sheva Alomar, partner to the main character, Chris Redfield. Co-op is implemented well and is fun to play with a friend online or on the same screen. But that's where the good ends.

The game is short. It'll take you 10 hours to beat the game, maybe 12 if you are the exploring type. The game is not designed as well as Resident Evil 4; without going into too much detail, you will only have reason to play the game through twice before its just no fun anymore. Besides the combat, you will partake is some excruciatingly easy puzzles, in which you are basically hand-fed the solutions to. Bosses are easy as well. Everything feels very dumbed down compared to Resident Evil 4. Even the inventory system has been re-designed to make it simpler for the player.

One of the things that made Resident Evil 4 so intense was the fact that the player was always low on ammo and tight on space. Battles had to be meticulously planned in the inventory and since ammo was sparse, the player had to be crafty. That was fun. But in Resident Evil 5, you are never really strapped for ammo, and you can almost always use your partner as a pack mule. It changes the game mechanic, making it much less interesting.

Speaking of intense, one of the things about Resident Evil 4 that made it so intense was the fact that it was truly scary and maintained a sense of horror and suspense. It made the game immursive; you really felt like you were alone in the dark. In Resident Evil 5, you are neither. Thanks to your partner and the sunny African setting, you'll never be alone or in the dark. Horror has left the game in Resident Evil 5, and with it went an undeniable sense of charm and excitement that is woefully missed.

Because that sense of Horror is absent and the game is more action oriented now, it seems kind of strange that the developers stuck with the setup where the player cannot walk and shoot at the same time. I know other reviewers address this all too often and to be honest, it is the most minor of my complaints in my opinion. Nevertheless, it is still worth noting.

This is not to say it is impossible to have fun in Resident Evil 5. It is a perfect rental, because it can be beaten quickly and once it is beaten, there is not much worth-while to return to. I'd say definitely find a way to play it, like co-op-ing it at a friends house, because the first time is a blast. Otherwise, I'd stick to Resident Evil 4. But trust me, you don't want to be the loser who actually paid full admission while the disc sits on the shelf collecting dust for years to come.

3.0,False,"08 28, 2012",A3EK1BZAWAHEYU,B001VLFCXW,P. Luna,"I have been looking for a realistic baseball game.  The overall rating for this game is a comparison between what I was looking for and what I found.  I give it is 3 stars. 5 will be what I was looking for and 4 is Wii Sports game.  However in terms of fun it has 5 stars.  I will explain why, as follows.

I was looking for a baseball game that had a realistic swing.  In Wii Sports Resort you can have direct control over your sword, while in The force unleased you swing sideways or up/down to trigger more complex sword moves that are not the moves you did with your Wii-mote.  So The force unleashed is not a realistic sword game, but an arcade game, as you do not have direct control over your sword.

In Wii Sports when you are swinging, same happens, you place your bat looking backwards, pointing slightly up or down and it determines the height of the swing.  Then you shake it forward to swing, so Wii-mote moves are not the one of the bat.  As you may know, this is not fully realistic, as you normally hold a real bat almost vertically before swinging, but it works.  So this is what I would call ""4 stars"" (very good, but not perfect).  Wii sports allows direct control as response is immediate and you can regulate the height of the swing, but not in a fully realistic way.  Realistic is what I would call ""5 stars"".

I was looking for such a realistic swing.  Bigs 2 offers a ""3 star"" experience, just like The Force unleashed, where shaking the Wii-mote makes the swing.  And regulating where you bat is not very intuitive so it requires trial and error.  Also, Bigs 2 swing seems to have a fraction of a second delay, so you swing and a few moments later the swing takes place, unlike Wii sports.  It is weird to make a decision to bat without even have time to see where the ball goes.  So it would be worthy of 2 stars.  So why I give it 3 stars to the game?

I am not a hardcore baseball fan, so I do not care if the roster is outdated or not, or if the faces look just like real players.  It would take a fan to make this evaluation.  So I am disregarding this aspect in this review.

What I know is that it looks fine for a Wii game (graphics) and motion of players look fine.  I also liked the way you do the fielding with the Wii-mote arrows.  It takes some time to get used, as in Wii Sports fielding is automatic (you have no control).

Also, the pitching is far more complex than Wii Sports, but I think it may be worth the extra effort (my subjective opinion, someone may disagree) as you exchange straight-forward pitching of Wii Sports for some more elaborate pitching with more stages.  So first you select where you want to throw, by pointing in a box, and then the point is fixed when you press an arrow in the Wii-mote to select the kind of throw.  Then you make the Wii-mote to point up and keep it there to regulate the force of the throw and then you shake down to throw, and you can add some rotation by twisting Wii-mote sideways.  It takes a while to get used.

Why is it an arcade game?  You can attach a Nunchuk, which is weird, as you would feel it is strange to have something hanging from your bat.  However it is better than having a gamepad like most of past consoles.  I never got used to gamepads.  So as you may guess, it is not a realistic game in terms of controls, it is an arcade game that uses Wii controls in a way where you have no direct/realistic control, just like The force unleashed.

Of course, I suspected it was an arcade game, as Amazon's specs say so.  So I am not disappointed, I knew I was taking a risk.  Why did I buy this game then?  Wii Sports does not have anyone commenting the game, the crowd in Wii Sports does not sound excited like in a real stadium, and players and camera angles are not just as cool as in real baseball games.

Developers may be proud of their effort.  However, if they wanted to go one step beyond, they may like to play PES 2012.  PES 2012 have very intuitive and straight-forward controls, and it takes advantage of Wii controls that makes it better than Fifa, and that makes the gaming experience very smooth and cool.

I will keep on dreaming on the day in which I can grab the Wii-mote like a real bat and have a realistic swing that has no delay.  Until then I will have to remain in the arcade baseball arena.  It is quite fun, but not realistic.  Well, it is an arcade game.",Arcade baseball,1346112000,,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii'},
3.0,False,"11 14, 2009",A3TK2IOP8UQ087,B000X9FV5M,Alabaster Jones,"Wow this game is a total mixed bag.  For every good thing about it, there are 2 things that will leave you scratching your head or breaking your keyboard in frustration.

First of all, The Story:  there is no story.  It's just a bunch of NPCs sending you to the other side of the map to either A) blow something up B) retrieve an object, or C) kill someone.  That's it.  Every mission is the same, and every area is just a copy/paste of the last one.  There is no variation here at all.  None.  The weapons, yes, but you'll probably find a combo that you like very early on and keep it for the whole game.

The Weapons:  There are a lot of them, but like I said, you'll likely find what you like early on and ignore the rest of them.  One thing that really annoys me about the weapon slot system is that if you want to carry a sniper rifle, it will be your primary weapon, which means that you cannot carry a battle or assault rifle with the sniper rifle.  This would be okay if the game were sniper friendly, but it is not.  You will be able to pick off a few enemies before they all either hide or rush you, at which point your sniper rifle is going to do you zero good.  It's nice to have, though, so I use it anyway.  I have the double barrel sawed-off shotgun as my secondary weapon, which helps, but it is horribly inaccurate even at point blank range.  The enemies have a nasty habit of becoming merely wounded from a close range shotgun blast to the head, which is annoying for 2 reasons.. one- because it's unrealistic, and two- because you are often unable to finish them off until they have completed their ""writhing in pain"" and ""getting up to shoot you"" animations.  Your shots will simply pass right through them until they have gotten up and put a couple of rounds into you.  Highly annoying.

The Vehicles:  They are nice when they work right, but the roads are too narrow and the map designers were sadistic enough to put obstacles all over the road that will permanently make your vehicle stuck.  It's best just to walk.  Speaking of vehicles, watching an enemy NPC try to drive one is one of the most hilarious things I've ever seen in a video game.  You try to attack an enemy outpost, and suddenly it's BAD DRIVERS TO THE RESCUE!  These guys will come roaring onto the scene - hitting trees, buildings, cars, each other, and whatever else they can find.  They will not get out of the car until they are satisfied that they have run over enough things, even if you are standing 5 feet away from them.  MAJOR LOLS to the NPC drivers in this game.

The Combat:  Ok.. this is obviously the whole point of this game.. killing people.  Depending on who you ask, the AI in this game is either completely brilliant or dumber than a rock.  Well, I say it's both or neither.  At times, the enemies do seem to display a realistic intelligence.  They will hold their posts if you snipe someone from a distance, but they will find cover.  On the other hand, you'll see about 3 or 4 of them running around in circles for all eternity until you get close enough for them to notice you.  That's if they notice you at all.  You can be face to face with some of these guys and they act like you're not even there.  Sometimes you can be right in front of someone and they will say something like ""Where did he go?""  Other times, even the slightest noise will have an entire camp of mercs firing at your exact position, no matter how far away you are or how hidden you are.  All of that being said, the combat is actually quite fun.  The AI is adequate (as long as they're on foot LOL), and even though I would certainly not call them ""smart"", they do provide a decent challenge in one way or another.  It really is quite satisfying to clear an area, because it is quite tough to do at times.  And then comes the disappointment when you walk 50 feet away, come back to the area, and find that every one of the mercs you just killed are back from the dead and ready to fight you all over again.  The respawning enemies in this game are terrible.  It was an awful idea, and it is the worst thing about this game.  Wait.. no.  Malaria is the worst thing about this game.  WTF?  Malaria?  Well at least it isn't AIDS.

Other Thoughts: There is a lot of fun to be found in this game, but playing it often feels like walking up a muddy hill in lead boots.  Everything from the lack of inventory screen, tediously designed menus, really weak jumping, gun jamming, and constant malaria symptoms will have you believing that this game was designed to punish you for buying it.  But, the graphics, sound, atmosphere, and unique combat might just make you keep playing it anyway.

Is it a bad game?  Yes.  It's a terrible game, but I like it anyway.

Why is it called Far Cry 2, by the way?  It has nothing at all to do with Far Cry.  Crysis is more of a sequel to Far Cry than this game is.

The controls are a little wonky since the camera angle gets messed up fairly regularly and each level seems to take forever since Elmo goes so slow through the levels.

Before that, there was Double Dragon and Renegade.  And that's just one subgenre.  It is perfectly common for a game to be released on the heels of another game, utilizing the same structure, topic, and style of gameplay.  In the case of Carrier, it is obvious that their developers stayed up a lot of nights playing Resident Evil.  But if you're going to rip off a game, at least attempt an improved version, not just a pale knock-off.
This game does nothing better than the Resident Evil series.  The graphics are worse by being so simple (and dark, dark to the point where I had to turn up the brightness on my TV to see necessary objects.)  The premise is twice as hokey as RE's S.T.A.R.S. group.  It isn't nearly as scary as RE.  The long stretches of dialogue exposition in Resident Evil were tolerable because they were interesting and revealed plot points.  Here, they are tediously boring.  RE has minimal backtracking, this has copious amounts of backtracking.  And, most comically, Resident Evil had one of the most cheesy, hokey, unbelievably delivered dialogue of any video game EVER.  So Carrier should have at least got THAT right, huh?  Well, sadly, no.  How Jaleco managed to find voice acting even MORE uninspired, boring, and wooden than RE, I'll never know, but they did.
So that's the story.  Gameplay is a mirror image of Resident Evil.  Same artistic backdrops, same wanky control, same ""spooky"" atmosphere and gradually revealing storyline.  Just twice as boring and unnecessary.  Especially now that RE2 and RE3 are available on Dreamcast, you might want to make Carrier the last of the ""survival horror"" titles you obtain for the Dreamcast.

I liked the skill tree that came with the game because it made character management far easier, the artistic style of the maze, and the new auto walking system.

But there were far more things that I didn't like on my play time in the game.  I can potentially understand the poor implementation of the touch screen controls in game.  I can accept the random encounters that can one-shot your characters, as Atlus has the hard game niche and it is good to have a game to challenge you.  No, my problem with the game is that I went and explored every inch of the first level of the maze at great peril to my characters, only to find doors and treasure chests in the first level of the game.  Normally, treasure chests and doors are good things in an RPG, but in this case they break the game.  This is because in the first level of an Etrian Odyssey game, they expect you to go and make a map of the first dungeon before letting you move on.  I am OK with this mission in theory, because it is a good way to get the player used to map making.  However, they threw in doors and treasure chests without telling us how to note these locations on the map.  Do doors occupy their own space on the path ahead of you?  Does the ground in front of the door count as a space?  Do treasure chests occupy a space?  Sadly, the game doesn't tell you any of this, and if your style is wrong the game won't let you continue.

  This game is bad man...  alright here we go:
Pros:
60+ Character availibilty
Kreate a Fighter

Cons:
Motor Kombat(?)
Kreate a Fatality
Konquest Mode
No Individual Fatalities
only one fighting style per character

  Right off the bat this game is a dissapointment... It looks beautiful and the fighting is fun but after a while you start realizing the limitations of the game and start thinking it might be a little more worthwhile to throw in Deception or Deadly Alliance.

  Here was the process...
 I put in the game started playing the regular kombat mode and it was interesting but i was looking forward to Konquest Mode because it was great in the last installment.  Well, Konquest Mode Armageddon? awful! I was done with it in less than 6 hours and it wasn't even worth it... It was very rushed and the story was awful.  And since when did Blaze all of a sudden become some unique supreme being? He was one of the lamest characters and still is...

 Alright so after being dissapointed with  that i ventured in the regular fighting mode... Than after toying with the Kreate a Fatality mode I was very angry...  This is the worst dissapointment in the whole game.  No individual Fatalities for the characters (Who is Meat anyway?) which basially kind of strips away their indiviuality oof being characters.  Sure there is sixty of them but nothing really makes them unique or worth it in the end. They don't even have one personal fatality... wow... If they gave the characters at least one fatality (TWO PREFERABLY) and had the Kreate a Fatality system, This would have been great. Also there are no character endings. it's just the character practicing their fighting tyle while taven (who is this wonder boy?) gives you a commentary of what happens?????? wow.....

Next, Motor Kombat(?)
  Alright Kombat Chess was a little lame. But much much better than this garbage...I won't even spend time writing about it...

Kreate a Fighter
  This is pretty cool.  But you have to go through the lame Konquest mode to even get the money to pay for your fighters stuff and abilities.  Not to mention you can only have one Kustom Kombatant per profile.  Those Lame wrestling games can do more why can't Mortal Kombat?

Ultimate MK3
This comes with the premium edition.  All in all it's nice and cool if you like the old school games and it a nice port of the arcade game.

All in all,
  This game was not thought all the way through.  It was rushed and not cared for by it's staff or ""Kreators"".  The basic idea was cool but fell extremely short.  You want the ultimate finale for MK on these consoles? here you go.
1. 2 fatalities per character

2. Keep kustom fatalities or axe them (your choice and who cares?)

3. the 60+ roster of fighters

4. Spend time on laying out your Konquest mode and make it actually worth while like you did in the last game.

5. Bring back friendships and Babalities Hell even Animalities And what happened to Hara Kiris? They were so good! Bring them back!!!!(Just for laughs, Do you know how cool that would have been?)

6. Give character specific endings as opposed to the terrible commentary on what happens.

7. Get the hell rid of Motor Kombat and use that space to fit the rest of the game.

The missions are too short.
I finished the whole thing in two days of play.

What I would have liked to see:
--Larger world = roam anywhere. You are restricted so much on where you can go in this. You are in a jungle, and run into hard plants.
--It's never clear what you can jump over or on. There are always some low objects that I wanted to jump over, and use for cover, but find out It's blocked by an invisible wall, and I die.
--I'd like to destroy anything. When I shoot a tree with a rocket, it should fall down. It should burn when a flame thrower hit's it. A wooden crate should blow up. Telephone poles should fall. Stacks of Tires should move, or roll, and Chairs should fly all over the place, etc.
--When guys are far away (even when you have a sniper rifle) they will not die if they are important later. There are guys in trees I can't kill, and people manning Artilary, that won't go down.
-- Also, shooting guys who are jumping something is a No-Go. They can not be killed as they leap over a stack of sandbags. You have to wait until they get into their run cycle again. Bad.
--Since they are trying to make it look better, I'd like to see some Winter fighting, or Rain.
--Some more random spawns. Every time you play, they enemy spawns in the same spot, with the same guys.
--Sound. The sound is bad. It's sounds nice, but I used sound to find things in COD4. In COD5, you hear somthing on the right, but it's infornt of you, on the Left. You can not rely on sound to find targets.
--Gravity. No gravity. Lining up a target that is 10 feet away is the same as 1000yards. no drop off or delay. The bullet is instant. Falling from a 2 story building gives no damage.
-- Enemy AI runs to the same spot every time. Not smart. But they will keep spawning until to you cross a hard-coded key location.
--In the past, you 'helped' your team. You kill some, they kill some. But here, your team, and the enemy, will keep spawning until you finish the map. You can sit back and watch for an hour, and neither side will 'win'.
--Collision. Your team will shoot through you. You'll have to kill a few team members to get a clean shot. They will stand right in front of you. You should be able to shove them while running, but you can not. I've gotten killed by my team running too slow while getting shot at.
--You can not shoot through stuff. In COD:ModWarfair, if you had a bigger gun, it shot through the walls or oil barrels. Here ... nope.
--Also, since it IS ""World"" at war, Adding the battles in Africa, China vs. Japan, British, French, would have been nice, considering how short the missions were.
I just think they did not progress much from COD2, if at all.

- it's not fun period.
- if you dare run off the track into a little spot of dirt, you might as well be driving a turtle in a tar pit. you drop from 100mph to 0 in .1 seconds. no i'm not exaggerating.
- if you happen to hit a side wall with the side of your car, instead of just bouncing back into the track with some kind of realistic action-reaction physics, you almost always have your back end spin out into the track infuriatingly. Totally unrealistic.
- textures are really mediocre (backgrounds, tracks, etc).
- tracks are boring. There are only a few that are inner city, downtown, with flashy lights and interesting things to enjoy. The rest are just pedestrian.
- graphics in general, are just okay. This is a next-gen title, it needs immersive ultra-realism.
- it gives you the illusion of track variety, but there are barely more than 10 or so...they're simply reused in different races.

Had this Madden been released in late August many may have been satisfied with it. The problem comes in having played a disappointing 360/PS3 game and then moving up to one here that isn't dramatically different. The run game is more realistic, the pocket and pass rush look great operate much better, receivers actually try to get two feet in on the sidelines, and the smarter defense makes things much more challenging. The new hardware also means simming through weeks in Franchise is instantaneous. Madden has played spectacularly well online - both in terms of online performance and the general gameplay balance.

The feature set is identical to the 360/PS3 version. Ultimate Team content can also transfer from 360 to One or PS3 to PS4.

Presentation and ""Living Worlds"" remains a huge disappointment and the graphics don't near the wow factor of the other sports titles. Some bizarre issues include CPU controlled players hurdling for no reason and defensive backs who suddenly stop in their tracks for a fraction of a second allowing a receiver to separate. There still isn't a true battle in the air on jump balls and automatic challenges on turnovers and close touchdowns remain notably absent.

Madden is probably the most difficult of the three sports games on both generations to evaluate. Is it worth buying if you already had the 360/PS3 version? Is it worth the $10 upgrade on Xbox One? If you haven't played Madden in the last year or more will this one be satisfying? Those are questions that fall on individuals rather than can be covered with distinct yes or nos. Regardless Madden still isn't where it should be and is a *distant* third behind NBA 2K14 and FIFA 14 on next-gen.

**************FULL REVIEW*****************

Madden NFL 25 was a disappointment on the Xbox 360 and PS3 but the arrival of the Xbox One and PS4 brings promise of a fully featured product with improved gameplay and atmosphere. That would certainly represent a much better entry situation than how the previous generation was welcomed in and for the most part EA Sports has achieved that goal. It just may not be enough to get consumers excited since the base product it builds on was already lagging so far behind in the minds of many.

---------HITS

-Subtle But Effective Gameplay Enhancements
The most evident improvement to the game comes with the offensive line blocking and defensive pass rush. Clean pockets are formed, ends handled properly, blitzes picked up, and assignments properly fulfilled. While the d-line still won't get a consistent pass rush from the front four there are occasions where an edge rusher will beat the tackle and those instances look great.

The difficulty in the run game has been notched up due to a greater sense of player weight and momentum. It takes a few games to get accustomed to how to run but once comfortable it becomes more rewarding. There isn't a whole lot of opportunity to use the special moves with the ""Precision Modifier"" though as attempting any kind of agile move just seems to be asking for trouble. This is especially seen in kickoff returns where it seems near impossible to get by the first tackler headed your way. That may have just as much do with blocking - they almost always are flying in unimpeded - but regardless not much success is found in the return game.

Improved AI is notable especially in the defense as the CPU has become much more challenging on the standard All-Pro difficulty setting. Defenders with their backs to the line of scrimmage won't magically turn around as soon as the QB throws a pass. Poor QBs also throw more inaccurate passes thankfully. To that point there is greater differentiation in the players. Having an Earl Thomas roam the field feels like it matters more now than ever. Players will mercifully try to get their feet in-bounds for catches - but this remains not totally consistent.

Bad clock management by the CPU is still present as teams will often run the ball in late half/game situations only to call a timeout right after. There is still no real fight for the ball on deep throws (which are too often thrown short giving the advantage to the DB) or jump balls. There are also hitches in movement with defenders as they occasionally stop dead in their tracks for a split second for no reason allowing for separation. The CPU loves to hurdle for no reason making them vulnerable to big hits and giving up yards that would have been gained otherwise.

-Fully Featured Product
EA Sports made a concerted effort to transfer over all the features present on the Xbox 360 and PS3 to the Xbox One and PS4. That includes the full Connected Franchise mode, Ultimate Team, and weekly roster updates. Online play has run exceptionally well and the better balanced gameplay has made them more enjoyable to play as a result. The only exceptions to this being a product where consumers know exactly what they are getting is with the loss of Game Face and the inability to import draft classes from NCAA Football 14.

-New Console-Specific Additions
The big one here is the in-game saves for offline games. Leave a game in progress and resume it later even after switching to a different title or turning off the consoles. For games in Online Franchise those can't be left and returned to but leaving them in a suspended state is a far more reasonable option with the new hardware. The PS4 offers screenshot and streaming capabilities while the Xbox One has highlight saving, editing, and uploading along with (currently broken) SmartGlass functionality. The stronger hardware means advancing in Franchise week-to-week is practically instantaneous.

----------MISSES

-Living Worlds
For the most part what has been advertised as a new ""Ignite Engine"" has turned out to simply be a term encompassing the various improvements implemented in the games. Hyped aspects like interactive sidelines are simply not present - and those sidelines look just as bad as ever while coaches don't react to events taking place. What's more awkward than seeing completely emotionless representations of Pete Carroll and Jim Harbaugh? Celebration cut scenes are still poorly stitched together and don't often fit within the context of what has just taken place.

The crowd is somewhat improved and reacts better to the events on the field but still has a ways to go. At least now the the stadium isn't half empty because of rain or snow! Commentary does offer additional lines and references to information within a season in Franchise mode but that area is still largely lacking. There aren't even any on-screen graphics or commentary references to standings and playoff positioning. Presentation as a whole has not changed from the 360/PS3 version outside of some crowd shots and a look at the owner in his box when playing as an owner in Franchise.

-Deficiencies Carrying Over From Last-Gen
The weak presentation - and the lack of ties to events within a Franchise during games - still heavily damages the enjoyment that can be had with the title. The improved crowd doesn't account for differences from stadium to stadium. There are still no surprise onside kicks and even the wind indicator still points in the wrong direction. Essentially the work completed went into the very specific areas of gameplay (blocking, AI, graphics) but otherwise the product is a carbon copy of the last-gen product in terms of presentation and features.

---------Summary
Had this been the game released at the end of August it likely would have been met with fairly positive reception. However as a next-gen title it falls short by failing to inspire in the same ways that NBA 2K14 and FIFA 14 have. It may be worth the $10 upgrade from 360 to One and it may be worth the $50 it is now on Amazon for those who didn't play the previous-gen version. Meanwhile those who pass on it for whatever reason can feel comfortable knowing it's not anything exceptional.

Once on next-gen though it's hard to go back because it does immediately demonstrate a sense of advancement. Those improvements shouldn't be discounted but the series is still far from reaching the level that consumers recognize it reasonably should be at.

I have been gaming for well over 15 years and have a career in technical support so I have pretty high expectations when I spend a lot of money for a game add-on.

This was my first wheel due to the value, guaranteed GT5 support, and the countless recommendations.  My lap times went up (bad) by 5 seconds on average (spent one week getting used to it).  This is normal, and it takes several weeks to get your times back.  Once you get to that point you can regularly achieve faster times than a controller.  I have to mention that when I tried the Thrustmaster F430 FFB (not the cockpit version) my lap times matched the controller on the third lap (impressive).

PRO'S
- value, very affordable for what you get
- loaded with features like an RA tuning wheel and full button re-mapping in GT5
(Set brake balance, traction control, abs, vsc on the fly, IDEAL for online shuffle races.)
- excellent pedals
- wheel felt nice
- very strong forcefeedback (FFB)
- Logitech is a trusted brand and has decent customer support
- Table mount was pretty sturdy and nicely designed (I have a very thin desk)
- Quality of the material was better than average

CON'S
- The paddle shifters were small, had no tactile feel, I often missed shifts, and it limits you from using other grip locations on the wheel.  TOTAL DEAL BREAKER FOR ME!
- I have tried several wheels and I spun out a lot more with this one (takes practice)
- Force Feedback at the lowest setting prevents using the shifter because it takes two hands to steer
- Force Feedback can knock you off your line on straightaways, the software sort of checks to see if you're holding onto the wheel.  It takes some getting used to
- I'd rather have the shifter detach so that I can mount it somewhere else
- ONE year warranty, competition offers much longer warranties

SUMMARY:
I feel that most people will be very happy with this wheel.  Enthusiasts are more than likely going to upgrade to the G27, Fanatec GT3 (German based company with known support issues.  The sales team doesn't go out of their way with promotions or even free shipping, so they won't earn my business), or Thustmaster T500 wheels within a year.

I really enjoyed my first few hours with the game. The setting at the start of the game is unique and intriguing, a blend of a medieval civilization with quirky Japanese monsters. And boy, you will certainly get to know those monsters quite well. The premise of the game centers around acquiring said monsters to use as your own fighting agents. After acquiring a pool of these quirky characters (each has their own personality), you can merger them together in a multitude of combinations to create more powerful beings.

This battle system is similar through SMT games, but SMT IV allows you to merge monsters at any time (compared to Persona 4, where you have to travel to a specific location to do this). The game really captured my attention for the first 8 hours or so, but the repetitiveness and overwhelming amount of monsters to collect and merge wore me out after a while. There's a fun twist about 1/4 through the game which energized me to push a little further, but I soon lost steam and haven't picked it up since.

48(!) characters join the fray this time as you once again take control of a personality of the time of the Three Kingdoms and do battle with your nemeses. Each character has their own storyline, complete with events seen only in that character's story (this is a plus, as it was quite tedious to fight through each kingdom multiple times in order to see all the characters in DW4). Weapons no longer need to be upgraded (another plus), and orbs are now rare items found by playing on hard mode. A ""chaos"" mode has been added, and it is NOT for the faint of heart (the difficulty is more like Very Hard mode in DW3:XL, as opposed to DW4:XL, but no one drops any meat buns!). The graphics are much better in this installment, and True Musou is actually more valuable than Musou in this game.

However, this game suffers from the same slowdown issues as the previous games (which is really unforgivable now, as this is the same game engine that has been used for six previous installments of DW). The siege weapons are even more useless here than in DW4 (unfortunate, since I thought that this could add a bit of depth to the strategy portion of this game). The camera is incredibly frustrating (not as much as, say, Samurai Warriors, but it's still pretty bad). Character balance is rather poor, though not as bad as previous installments (Lu Bu and Zuo Ci are incredible, Zhang Jiao and Meng Huo are horrible, the rest are OK). While large battlefields are nice, the game is frustrating until you obtain a horse saddle (another rare item).

All in all, I love the game. Why 3 stars? Well, I'm trying to diminish my bias. The fact is, if you are a fan of these games, you've probably already purchased this. If you didn't like the others, you won't like this one. And if you have never played a DW game before, this is probably the best of the lot. Still, I would have enjoyed a bit more originality and variety in this one (really, it plays exactly like DW2, which is five years old).","More dumb fun, but a bit hackneyed now...",1115078400,7,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},

Unfortunately for Vader, you aren't quite as perfect as he had hoped. You still have feelings and memories which interfere with his direct commands. You are still in love with Juno - and Vader is furious with you for your failings.

The graphics are lovely. You're a dual-wielding saber dude who can bash everything within sight. You gain points as you destroy objects, and unlock challenges. You fight stormtroopers and robots of all shapes and sizes. The stirring Star Wars music is everywhere.

The game is quite forgiving. When you die you usually start very close to where you left off. So you are encouraged to just plow ahead and tackle enemies. And the game supports that. You're starting out as a well trained soldier, not as a newbie. So right from the beginning you take on enemies with power and skill.

There are tweaks that you can do to your lightsaber, like adding gems to give them color changes and bonusses. But on the other hand you're stuck with your one character. He is the way he is. He can't have dark skin, or be female, or anything else. In our modern world that's quite bizarre. Why can't you use a character that connects with you?

These are all minor issues compared with the one massive failing of this game, though. It is incredibly short. You could pick it up on a Friday after work, expect to sit down to a long weekend of game playing fun. And then you're barely through your third slice of pizza and THE GAME ENDS. Sure you might expect four hour gameplay if it was a cheap download that you got to pass the time until you headed out to a movie. But for a full price game? A game with this history? It makes absolutely no sense at all.

Sure you can replay it on a harder level. Sure you can do some of the challenges. But when you get a game like this you expect a fairly long, epic-style story with character development, plot twists, and intrigue.

Finally, we have had the game crash on us at the hardest level.

The Bad: Terrible soundtrack, no custom soundtrack, very simple, shallow customization

The PSP is chalk full of racing games and probably more so than any other handheld or console. The reason being is that racing games are perfect for a handheld format, the PSP can display nice graphics, great physics (very important in a racer), and the analog nub is perfect for this. While there are dozens of mediocre to poor racers on the PSP Arctic Edge is not. Being one of the best looking games on the system is a real plus, but it's the fast paced action that MotorStorm fans have grown to love that really pulls it in first place.

One thing I love about Arctic Edge are the menus; they're easy to navigate and aren't a jumbled mess. Getting in the career mode is simple since they put all the events on a rotating column that you slowly rise depending on your rank. You can place 1st, 2nd, or 3rd in each race to earn points to advance to your next rank. There are a few race types that include regular races, checkpoint races, time trials and so on. After you select your even you get to choose from a selection of vehicles and there are many types. Ranging from snowmobiles, to bikes, ATVs, snow trucks, and many more you'll have a large variety. Each vehicle handles different on certain terrain so choose wisely.

When it comes to actually racing you're in for a treat. You get a boost meter, but this can be used as many times as you want just as long as you don't overheat your vehicle and blow it up. You can cool down your meter by driving through water or deep snow. I found this very unique since I can't recall it ever being done in another racing game. If that's not enough to entice you the sense of speed is amazing. The only problem is I wish there were some blur effects or something, but what they do works just fine. There are different paths you can take on the tracks and depending on your vehicle some may not be a wise choice. The higher paths are tended for smaller vehicles, and the lower paths are for larger vehicles. Each track is laid out with deadly obstacles that you can smash into, but a quick press of the reset button will get your back on your wheels. The core of the racing is just really fun, but it does get repetitious after awhile since that's all there is to do.

Customizing your vehicles is nothing special since it's your bare bones basics. I really wish that if there's going to be customization make it deep or don't bother at all. You can unlock new parts, but all the upgrading is cosmetic only since you unlock faster cars.

The multi player is what will keep you coming back since there's infrastructure. Yes, I know I know...all PSP games should have this in their multi player and the racing is great since the computer controlled AI is very odd. My only real hate in the game is no custom soundtracks.

 The story is made of 2 minuit missions which absouluty have no point at all.

The aforementioned rapid response missions are a nightmare as for every strike on any object the counter will add 2 seconds to your already tight time limit. Once you slam into the guard rail you'll never get control of your car back and you'll just be slamming from side to side across the road. You'll never beat the mission.

The Bad: Weak puzzles, very short, very hard, feels unfinished slightly, missing most of the console elements

The first thing you will notice when you play Dante's Inferno is that it's a bold game. The game is one of the darkest, nastiest, most mature games ever created and it makes Christianity look like a damned fool. The game is about a man named Dante who is a crusader and betrays his love Beatrice. Upon his return to Florence he sees her dead and watches as Lucifer takes her into hell and Dante follows.

The story is pretty good and keeps you interested, but its predictable. The game goes extremely deep in Christian and Greek mythology and pulls out names only hardcore followers would know, but enough of the story let's get to game play.

The game has a pretty damn solid combat system. You use your scythe as your main weapons and you have a cross projectile attack. You can do aerial combat, launch enemies into the air, and use your magic. You can unlock moves by following the holy or unholy paths (which doesn't actually affect the story) and each tree has a different set of moves. You can have four different magic items equipped and all are useful and powerful. One of the first elements you'll find that they took away are the relics. They are gone! These really helped you in the console versions, but they are nowhere to be found here. Anyways, the combat system is fluid, fast, and powerful and very deadly. Another element they took away from combat was the Redemption meter. Geez guys why did you butcher this?! With those two things aside the combat is fast and as fluid as it is on he consoles.

When it comes to exploration Inferno both satisfies and disappoints. The game has you descending into the 9 circles of hell and each is harder, deadly, and more brutal. Some levels are pretty epic like The City of Dis, Limbo, and some disappoint like Lust (just an ascending tower), and Gluttony (just fight Cerberus and a few baddies and your down to the next level). The levels are varied in length and I wish they would have been fleshed out more. Puzzle solving is pretty rare and when you do get some puzzles they are pretty easy to solve. However, most of the puzzles have been solved for you. Yeah why?! Not only this but a lot of the game's intense sections are videos of game play from the PS3 version. One example is the part when you kill Charon and ride the giant minotaur up the crumbling bridge. You don't get to play this part; instead you watch it...lame.

One thing I have to get straight is that the game is pretty epic. Not God of War epic but enough to keep it very cinematic. There are QTE's in the game such as when you take down a minotaur to ride it, take down bosses etc. You can punish or absolve most enemies to get feed your tree paths, there are famous historical figures that you find throughout the game that you can punish or absolve upon reading what they ended up in hell for.

The game's visual style is very impressive. Its what you think hell wold look like...dark, disgusting, and evil. The Gluttony level is a good example since you are walking through intestines, bile, puke, and so forth. The Lust level has female enemies wombs coming out of them to attack you. A giant Cleopatra with tongues coming out of her nippies and evil babies...yes its bizarre, but it works and its amazing to look at. However, on the PSP its obviously downgraded quite a bit and a lot of the beauty from the consoles is lost in translation.

The game is also extremely difficult even on the easy setting. Wave after wave of enemies come at you from all directions, bosses are extremely hard to beat, and the game can be very frustrating often. However, the game's major flaws are mainly the length, difficulty, and the fact that the levels weren't developed to their fullest potential.

So with the flaws of the console still here plus relics, redemption, puzzles, and a lot of other things removed from the game you still get a solid Dante's Inferno Lite for people who are on the go or don't own an Xbox 360 or PS3 (you should!)",A poor port that cuts stuff out,1332892800,,{'Platform:': ' Sony PSP'},

The Bad: Infuriating puzzle levels, not much gameplay outside of that, a little on the short side, control issues

I usually regret playing Atlus games because they are frustrating and difficult experiences. The games are usually excellent, but the difficulty always leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. I have only been able to complete a couple of Atlus games due to this. Catherine is no different, but shouldn't be taken lightly. RPG fans stay away. If you just want to experience the story go on YouTube. This is for hardcore puzzle fans only. I mean the hardest of core puzzle gamers. This game will leave you infuriated, angry, full of rage, and probably with a few smashed controllers. The game is plagued with issues, but for some reason there's the story that makes you want to see the end. Thankfully the game isn't very long. Just prepare the video walkthroughs because you will need them.

This experience is coming from someone who hates these kind of puzzles. This game is completely to taste. I hate block pushing puzzles, but here we are with a very deep game that includes these. The first three stages aren't that bad. Starting at stage 4 things get frustrating and forget about progressive difficulty. First off, the story is very engaging and it's a love story. A man named Vincent Brooks is in love with a girl named Katherine and she wants him to marry her. Suddenly a sultry seductress named Catherine comes along and somehow Vincent wakes up with her naked next to him. The rest of the game is him trying to hide each Katherine from each other.

The story gets tense in spots like any well written drama. When you are in the Stray Sheep bar you will receive text messages on your phone that you can reply to. Be careful because this will affect your morality meter which will impact the way Vincent handles inner conflict. I had a lot of fun replying to these texts because it's almost like you are actually doing it and in this relationship yourself. Atlus did a great job bringing you into this problem. Of course every night when Vincent dreams you are brought to an area where you climb an endless tower of blocks with other sheep, and that's where you start to hate or love the game.

I can't really explain the methods of all the block pushing because there are over a dozen that you learn throughout the game. You can push blocks horizontally, but it's not so simple. There are other types of blocks like heavy ones, ice, traps, randomly changing, and other blocks that will make your life hell. It was nigh impossible to figure most of these out without a video walkthrough because otherwise you will be restarting dozens of times due to trial and error. To make things harder the stage is crumbling underneath you. To make things even tougher you are awarded medals at the end. The only way to get gold is to keep your step multiplier up throughout the whole level and never mess up. Sure, there are checkpoints every so often, but I had such a tough time that even the video walkthroughs didn't help some times.

There are items you can pick up that help that create one extra block, allow you to jump 2 blocks, kill enemies, and turn all blocks to normal. You can pick up coins along the way to increase your score as well. At the end of each stage there is a boss that you must run from and tries to kill you. These changed up the pace, but just made things even more frustrating. You just can't catch a break during these puzzle levels. Even the controls are terrible with reversed control when crawling around behind the blocks, delays, and strange quirks that will make you die just because of control problems.

I really felt like this was a puzzle game with a love story wrapped around it. The game is tough, and I highly suggest a rental first because most people won't even finish this game. Don't think this is something like Pushmo with a reset button. Some levels take over ten minutes to complete. There is a co-op mode you can unlock, but all you will do is lose friendships. The best parts are the story in between and questions that you answer that even make you question the way you view romanticism and maybe even your own relationship. I even liked how you could see how other people answered. Besides these puzzles and answering text messages, there is no other gameplay apart from talking to people.

Overall, Catherine is a love/hate thing. Puzzle fans will fall in love with this, but RPG and other genre fans will hate it. I only hated the puzzle stages, but loved the story. With the puzzle levels being 90% of the game I can't really give this a higher score even if I wanted to. It is gripping, exciting, steamy, and can go any way. The anime cut scenes are beautifully done, and even the English voice acting is tolerable, but I would have preferred the Japanese voices with English subtitles.

3.0,False,"05 1, 2011",ASQV44WO5LI9W,B000MJB0H6,bluehobbes_7,"I write this review as someone who played Pokemon Red, Blue, and Silver way back in my happy, carefree childhood days.

The Diamond/Pearl generation marks the debut of the core Pokemon series on the DS. It isn't as strong a return as I was hoping for.

Let's start with the Pokemon themselves. Each new generation of Pokemon is less and less likable to me. They just seem to have less personality than the original generation. And there are more legendary Pokemon running around than we know what to do with. Articuno, Zapdos, Moltres, Mewtwo...who were they, again? The status of being a ""legendary Pokemon"" has lost its lustor. What I'm trying to get at is that Dialga and Pakia, like many others in the new generation, are unlikeable and lifeless, whereas the original legendaries (and the original 150, for that matter) were brimming with character and lovability (yes, even Mewtwo).

The gameplay has mostly been conserved. There aren't really any innovations that really jump out at you. The Pokemon in battles are still represented with sprites and still growl in 8-bit, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. My problem with the battle sequences is that they seem really slow for some reason, even with text scrolling set on fast and battle scenes set off. It takes forever to execute the attack and show the resulting drain on HP or status effect.

The story is also standard Pokemon fare. I was definitely hoping for something new on this front. Ever since the original Red and Blue, the story has consisted of your character battling through the gyms up to the Elite 4, while taking down an iteration of Team Rocket on the way. A different storyline would, I believe, greatly benefit any Pokemon games to come in the future.

Overall, is is a decent game that simply pales in comparison to the experiences offered by its predecessors. Players new to Pokemon will probably enjoy the game more than people who have been playing Pokemon since the beginning, simply because they will not have the same hollow feeling that those who grew up playing Pokemon will have. Really, this game just made me want to dust off my Red cartridge and take a heavy dose of nostalgia to cure my disappointment.",Pokemon Diamond/Pearl Review,1304208000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Specifically, finding a graphic way to bring the series animation to what should be a super bloody hack and slash console game and have it make sense...all while retaining the unique style of the series through the characters, story, design and music.

The folks that made this game, to my surprise, nailed the crap outta the hard part. Which should make this game be all kinds of super awesome and a ton of fun to play. The game retains all of the violence, RZA and Samuel L. Jackson goodness that the series had, and presents it all in a really swank and surprisingly cohesive way.

However, if you've read a review of this game then you may have heard mention of the very ""brokeashell"" in-game camera. This is because (as awesome as this game is), the camera is, in fact, dysfunctional beyond belief. However, if you give this game a little bit of time you will eventually get ""used"" to the camera and stop fighting it as much as you progress through the game. But, and I'm not going to lie here, that process will drive you nuts in the first couple of stages. So with that being the case, is this game worth playing through?

Yepper.

And here's why. When the camera does behave and isn't whipping around for no reason, chopping up frames, and generally blocking your view of what you need to see - it does deliver some of the straight-up coolest hip-hop infused samurai action moments in the history of histories... chock full of body parts, buckets o' blood in slo-mo, and it's all To The Beat.

If this game were rereleased with a functioning camera, it would be a solid 5 star game. No joke.

So while it definitely sucks, the camera doesn't make this game as unplayable as some folks'll lead you to believe. The game is certainly worth your time, and I would say money... but not at full price. I am a fan (not huge, but def a fan) of the series and actually enjoyed this game.

I'd say, unless you are super hardcore fan of the series, this game doesn't hold up well enough to buy new. Rent it or buy it used.

In summation - If you're into the series or just into the wonderful Reeses Peanut Butter Cup of Awesomeness that is the combination of Samurai Action + Hip Hop culture, then this game is certainly worth playing, but with the whole camera issue...not exactly worth owning outright at a new price.",Almost Afro-tastic....,1234137600,,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

In Archon, you had the opportunity to cast more than one spell per game, and the spells were a legitimate element of high strategy.  In Wrath Unleashed, not only do the spells have terrible range, but the only spells worth it use up the entire magic bar by themselves.  With magic as a one-time deal, it puts the majority of the strategy upon the actual combat system.

The combat system is bad.  A huge amount of loading time (read: 30 seconds for each and every combat, one level requires 10-20 combats, adds up quick).

The combat controls have a terrible learning curve, because what the buttons do is not in the instruction manual.  Figuring out how to block took me forty five minutes and an internet search.  Partially because the characters you are fighting with are hard to control.  Once an attack chain starts, you cannot stop it.

One of the better things about the original Archon was that ranged attacks never ran out, so it was possible for a weaker unit played skillfully to defeat a superior foe.  In Wrath Unleashed, you have in combat magic bars... once those are gone, you are basically at the mercy (read: you will lose) of the melee combat system.  This is another layer of strategy that has been removed, much like the variable terrain advantages (switch between light and dark with the turns) of the original Archon.

I planned on playing through this game at one point, but I had so many better games to play first I finally donated it to Goodwill.  (Four years later with only 2 hours of total play.)  I realized playing Wrath Unleashed was 'unfun' and decided not to waste my time.

I am assuming this is a game issue and not a PS4 issue as I have not had this issue with any other PS4 game.  This game has locked up on us twice in the past few weeks when we have been playing it more again after getting some new skylanders for Christmas.  Once was in the middle of a level, and once was in the initial world and trying to return to the main screen.  What is much worse, when we returned to the game after closing it we were greeting with a warning saying our save file is corrupt and would be deleted and we lost all of our progress in the game.  This is just inexcusable and frustrating.  I got onto some blog/forums and see I am not the only one who has had this issue with a lot of people reporting it when trying to use the ""Go to Main Screen"" menu option which I guess I will no longer try to do""  It certainly does not make one want to play the game when you feel like at any moment all of your progress could be lost.  After the second time, I completely deleted all game data (not just the save file) off of the PS4 and I so far it hasn't happened again but who knows.  END OF UPDATE***

I am finding this game to be a bit glitchy.  There are some collision detection issues.  If we leave the PS4 on because we are halfway through a level and don't want to lose our progress, the game is often froze up when we come back.  Sometimes at the main screen there are these visible portals to go into that I don't think are supposed to be there since they go away if you restart and block characters that are talking on the screen.  There are some real issues with some of the bounce pads/air vents/water jets if you are playing with more than one player where the game really gets all kinds of messed up if you aren't exactly together (which can be hard for small kids). The screen will start just jumping around as you go into a cycle of dying and respawning centering on the two characters and it can be hard to break out of.  However, there are also so really cool things in the game.  The voice acting again is great.  Graphics don't seem quite as sharp as Swap Force to me but are still very good.  I like that skystones is back but I like the old version better than this new version.  It seems like they dumbed it down a bit (possibly for smaller kids).  I love the traps and being the villains and the kids really get a kick out of trapping enemies and hearing their voice get ""sucked"" into the trap.  I'm not in love with them introducing yet another element.  It kind of annoys me they couldn't even throw you a bone to make your swappable Swap Force characters or actual Giant's from Giants still do something special, even if it was just a few secret worlds, and that you must have a trap-master to unlock elemental gates. This game has always been a cash grab but it just feels like this iteration is starting to cross the line a bit to me as someone who has been pretty willing to spend money on figures.  I think Activision needs to be careful about making sure the money you've spent continues to be useful in future games and for goodness sake we do not need more elements introduced and GET THE BUGS OUT!!!","Is this the start of the decline of Skylanders?

Graphics-

The graphics look good, but there's a catch. In the past NG titles I played through, there was never an issue with texture pop-in or muddy textures. However, I noticed that a lot in this game; especially if you turn the brightness up. At it's default setting, it looks really good. The graphical bugs really started showing up after about the 4th or 5th level. Especially in the jungle level which could be downright brutal looking at times.
I'm sure NG fans remember how good Ninja Gaiden and NG black looked, then, NG2 followed right in it's footsteps delivering excellent graphics.
With that said, NG3 does offer it's graphical perks and the effects are quite flashy. There's a ton of blood in this game; but no decapitations or limb hacking. Most will complain about it, and I admit that I missed the decapitations, but for the most part, I was content with the new direction.
Another issue I had with the graphics was the framerate and resolution clarity. No matter what resolution I chose, the game still had that muddy look at times while past NG had a much more crisp image with clarity.
I'd compare the graphics to Microsoft's Ninja Blade; but I'd give the edge to Ninja Blade without doubt.

Sound-

At first, the character groans seemed cool. That is...until you hear them a million times. The bad guys death groans sound identical and it does get annoying at times. The music wasn't exactly my cup of tea and to be honest, none of the tunes are memorable in my opinion. You get the same fight music every time you fight which is reminiscent of Devil May Cry, the voice acting on the other hand is pretty good. I wasn't exactly crazy about Ryu's voice. He'd sound much better with a more ""gruff"" sound than his generic voice pattern.
Meh.

Gameplay-

Not really a fan of it. In the past NG games, there was much more to do than simply fight wave after wave of enemy. Heck, there may be more variety in Dynasty Warriors games than this.
I really didn't like the fact that it had such limited platforming sequences, lack of exploration or hidden goodies, you can't level up your weapon (instead, you're given a new weapon ever so often), and despite the fact that the demo featured 3 weapons, you only get ONE MELEE WEAPON (SWORD), a bow or some shurikens. If you check DLC, you can ""buy"" a pack of weapons...really? That was easily the worst aspect about this game.
I did enjoy some of the boss battles such as the copter fight, but then there were some really dumb boss fights. For example, you'll fight a big T-Rex, that has the most predictable pattern of attacking. No matter how you amp the difficulty, this dinosaur is about as stupid as a boss can be. It will chase you and bash it's own head then fall down leaving itself open to being attacked. It can also bite you or swing it's tail, but it's primary attack would be the same charge over and over. This was such a dull boss fight that I wouldn't dare play it again.

There's no Muramasa shop. In fact, after every battle, you're instantly healed based on how good you do during fights. You also have one magic attack and after it's initiated, you can either kill enemies in one blow whilst being healed.

In all honesty, this game isn't even worthy of the Ninja Gaiden title. It took gamers the longest to master the original Ninja Gaiden and the first boss who was your master was really difficult to defeat in the first Ninja Gaiden. Not only were the bosses in NG1 extremely hard, but the enemies were nightmares. Did Tecmo/Team Ninja forget about the ""black ninjas"" which required so much skill to defeat?
Instead, what you get is a game with the Ninja Gaiden license that lacks everything that was fun about the previous games.

I'll admit that it can be a fun game at times, but after fighting wave after wave of enemies, lack of weapons or upgrades, a forgettable story, and a glitchy multiplayer, this is the worst of the series. It reminds me of Devil May Cry 2 only not as good. If you can get it cheap, buy it for achievements and some action.

3.0,False,"04 15, 2008",A1DBQOB2CVLDOS,B000Z3VI58,Chris Van Deelen,"There seems to be a trend as of late to create Xbox 360 first person shooters that involve team-mates.

I played Army of two about a month ago, and I really enjoyed it. So, I decided to give Conflict: Denied ops a whirl as well.

What I got for my money was just an average offering. There wasn't all that much that really stuck out in my mind about the game, with one exception, which I'll get to later.

Don't get me wrong, it was fun, and I think it was worth playing.

The game is about two CIA operatives, one named Lincoln Graves, a former marine sniper, and his partner, Reggie Lang.  The game revolves around you controlling one or the other in ten different missions, each one taking you to a different location across the globe, but all being interconnected.

Graves is a sniper, and is best to use if you need stealth, while Lang is big, muscular, and uses a machine gun. Not good for subtleness, but when you need a heavy hitter, he's your man.

Ok, the game play itself. I've said this before in several of my previous reviews about the way first person shooters are portrayed with the 360. You don't have a health meter, or an armour meter for that matter. The more damage you take, the screen becomes blurred and tinged red. The worse this becomes, the closer you are to dying.

And, as I've said numerous times, when that happens, get your rear to cover. But, there is a difference this time around. A very important difference!  If you're taken down, you can switch over to control your partner and get him to come up to you and heal you.

Of course, if he gets taken down, that's all she wrote. You'll have to reload from the last checkpoint.

One thing I need to point out though - you should keep some space between yourself and your partner. There are a few areas that if you're both together, one hit and its game over man, game over! The upside is that you have three minutes to get to your partner once he's down. If you can't do it in that time, your partner dies, and the mission ends. Time to reload from a previous check point.

Switching control is a simple pull of the button, and you have only three basic commands to give to your partner. Stay with me, go to a specific location, or stay put. Use em wisely!

You really don't have much of a variety of weapons to use in the game. You start out with a handgun and a sniper rifle. As you progress the missions, you get automatic upgrades for your weapons, such as a grenade launcher for Lang, and an under barrel shotgun for Graves.

One important feature to point out is that you can never run out of ammunition, so if you want to, spray it, don't say it!  However, that being said, you can run out of explosives such as grenades and mines.

But, that's not even a huge issue, as you will find places in each mission that you can restock on explosives - not only your grenades, but for the grenade launcher and the rocket launcher as well.

Your missions, as I stated above, really do take you around the globe. You start out in a small South American country (Sorry, I can't remember the name off the top of my head), in the middle of a civil war. From there you have nine more missions, which take you to a monastery, a diamond mine, the Arctic Circle, an oil refinery, a lumber mill, a submarine pen, an oil tanker on the high seas and a military base. I know that I'm missing one, so forgive me, I completed the game a week before I started to write this review.

So, you have no shortage of exotic locations to visit.

A couple of the missions do involve stealth, so I'd suggest using Graves to start and have him find the best path to take. Control Lang after you have Graves in place, don't get him to auto-follow. I don't know if it would work or not, but I felt safer controlling him on my own.

And, the stealthier you are, the easier time you'll have of it. Once you're cover is blown, the enemy will be all over you like white on rice.

There are several times during the game that you'll be given the chance to control a vehicle. You can drive a tank, hovercraft and an APC. The controls weren't the best, I found them annoying to use. One control stick controlled the direction your vehicle traveled, the other aiming your weapons. If you're not careful, you could find yourself driving backwards while firing when you wanted to go sideways or even forward.

That is one issue I've had with many of the games I've played. The programmers really need to come up with a better control system for vehicle operation.

As for the music, there really wasn't anything that jumped out and struck me as being really good. Not like Frontlines: Fuel of war. Still, it was well done, and in the background, not overbearing at all.

I have played games in the past in which the background music was so loud that I missed some of the dialogue that took place during the cut scenes. That wasn't the case with this game.

The graphics were your typical Xbox 360 graphics. Crisp, well defined, easy to watch. I didn't see any issues with enemy targets getting stuck inside other objects like I've seen with a few of the more recent games I've played.

Although, there were a couple of occasions where, when one of the characters I was controlling got taken down that his gun would be lost inside the ground, or stuck in a wall or the like.

But these were minor, and they didn't affect the game play in any way, shape or form.

The cut scenes were brief, and did help propel the storyline forward, and most of these scenes involved Graves and Lang. To be honest, I found Graves living up to his nickname during the game. The character wasn't really likeable at all, unlike, in my personal view, Lang.

You can judge that on your own, after all, my opinion is just that, mine. If people agree with it, great, if they don't, no big deal either.

Since I brought up the enemies earlier, I should mention the AI controlling them. They don't stand around. They move from cover to cover, they will attempt to flank you. If you stay in one place, watch out for grenades being tossed in your direction.

Again, also, if you stay in one place for too long, the enemy will more often than not try to come and flush you out, or get to a better position in order to make short work of you and your partner. Movement around the maps is key for survival.

Speaking of maps, some of the maps you play on are huge! There are many twists and turns, and it would be a good idea to explore every nook and cranny as quite often they will contain enemy soldiers that, once you've taken care of a group of them and you think your safe, one could come up and end your game real fast. Besides, doing that will help you find more places you can restock your explosives as well.

Another thing that really caught my interest was the destroyable environment. You could wreak as much havoc as you wished, tons of things, including many buildings, were completely destructible. In fact, you can even gain an achievement for destroying your environment.

Lastly, I didn't bother trying any of the multiplayer functions in the game. I'm a solo player and don't really gain any enjoyment from trying these games online with strangers.

In conclusion, as I stated at the beginning of the review, the game wasn't bad. It was fun, and the story kept me interested, even though it was a little confusing at times - why the team happened to be going to one specific location, what it had to do with the overall arc, that sort of thing.

Now, I mentioned one thing that really stuck out in my mind at the beginning of the review... it didn't take me five or six hours to beat the game! All in all, I played it for almost 11 hours in total.

I hate how short most games are today! This was refreshing.

Pros
- Length of the game. Ten missions.
- Destructible environment
- Smart enemy AI.
- Lots of exotic locations and huge maps to play on.

Cons
- If you don't complete a mission, when you play again, you have to start over from the beginning of that particular mission.
- Some of the levels had a serious frustration factor involved. A few extra check points would have been appreciated.
- Poor vehicle controls.

All-in-all, I wouldn't call this a must have launch title.  I would personally wait for it to drop to $20-$30 next year instead of paying $60 upfront now.  The campaign is fun but gets repetitive and frustrating at times.  I found myself repeating certain battles many times and the boss fights at the end all felt the same.  I liked that I could use different materials when making Knack bigger or smaller but, at those times, it was simply to defeat a specific enemy and not carry on the rest of the game.  Seeing Knack made out of logs that were on fire was fun but that form was used to defeat enemies made of ice.  After that, it had no purpose and didn't carry through to the next stage.

The graphics are pretty top notch and come off with a DreamWorks animated feel to them.  These aren't super realistic, Killzone level graphics but they are nice nonetheless.  The game play was really fluid and I didn't encounter any framerate issues (i.e. stuttering) during the game.  The co-op missions seem fun and there are some things that can be collected with a few replays but I don't see much replay value here.  Once you beat the campaign, you'll likely be done with the game.

The main selling point is the single-player campaign.  As I said, it does get repetitive and the difficulty seems to lack any scale.  There's one point when I was huge taking down most enemies rather easily.  I then encountered an enemy who shot me once and I died.  Some enemies require strategy when attacking them but I feel this inconsistent difficulty level makes the game frustrating.  I had to repeat a few parts 2-3 times before I could move on.  It would have been nice to have a solid difficulty throughout the game and not experience hard sections only to be faced with a boss that was either way too easy or way too hard to beat.

Overall, this is a fun title but it wore thin on me.  I don't see much, if any, replay value in this game so I can't really justify spending $60 on it (like I did) only to play through once and not do much else with it.  The game could have had a more balanced difficulty and some enemies felt cheap.  Younger gamers will likely enjoy this but may get turned off by the sporadic spikes in difficulty.  I don't think this is a must have launch title.  I kept going back to Call of Duty Ghosts, Assassin's Creed IV, and NBA 2K14 over Knack as those were able to hold my attention more and had consistent difficulties.  I'd wait until Knack comes down in price and then buy it.  Until then, it's just OK and has room for improvement.  This reminds me a lot of Kameo when the Xbox 360 first launched.  It was fun but not necessarily a AAA launch title.",A little disappointing,1384300800,28,,

Now this isn't too much of a problem really, but it's rather insulting that it's called ""Story of Seasons"" when the farming mechanics are clunky and it's not as smooth as any recent Harvest Moon game... or Story of Seasons for that matter.

Gameplay - Solid gameplay, very similar to Tiger 14. Three gameplay styles help satisfy preference(s) of individual user.
Graphics - The game looks great. It really shines on the fantasy courses that have beautiful backdrops (IE: Grand Canyon) and/or moving aspects (trains, hot air balloons).
Night Club Challenge - The most in-depth feature in the game and a nice way to get better at individual skills in the game.
Quick Rounds - A nice new option to help make rounds/events go faster by just playing a handful of holes per round. (There is an option to play full rounds. Game defaults to Quick Rounds, BTW).
Fantasy Courses - As mentioned above, these courses look great and are fun and challenging.
Commentary - It exceeded my expectations for being the first-year commentary team.
Presentation - The Golf Channel presentation is sharp and helps with immersion. I'd like to see it expanded in the future, however.

DISLIKES:
Lack of GameFace & Player Customization - No GameFace hurts immersion and the templates/options in-game are very basic.
Basic Career Mode - The career mode is very basic (golf and advance) with some missing basic features, such as a viewable schedule.
Lack of Online/Community-Centric Feature(s) - Maybe the biggest issue with the game. Longevity is a concern. A long-term issue with the franchise; they have been slow and uninspiring when it comes to implementing community-building features. For being in the same studio as NCAA Football (Online Dynasty) and Madden NFL (Connected Franchise), it's disappointing that PGA TOUR has not added in a similar online career mode. The existing online features are the traditional Head 2 Head and Online Tournaments.
Lack of Tiebreaker Playoff - Very discouraging to finish an event tied for first with no tie-breaker.
Lack of Licensed Golfers & Courses - Over time, the low number of courses could become an issue.

When compared to Tiger 14, McIlroy PGA TOUR probably deserves around a 5-6. However, on its own merits I would give it closer to a 6-7.

The game plays a solid game of golf, looks great, but my concern is that it lacks longevity due to a bare-bones Career Mode, a relatively low number of courses, and no community-building features (IE: online leagues).

Overall I like the game but it needs improvements. It feels and looks like the 40's and is a nice revisiting of the movie, which I wanted to watch again after playing awhile! You can create your character from hairstyle and eye color to height of eyebrows and size of ears. It satisfies my shoot 'em up craving and has some fun melee effects. You can toss people out of windows, over ledges, in front of moving cars and you can strangle them and bash their head into walls and solid objects. The greatest thing about it is it has the sweetest duck, cover and shoot system I have ever played.  The weapons are nice with 3 upgrade levels, each with a noticeable difference in fire power and speed. You cant just charge in blasting and expect to survive you must carefully plan your attack and use your wits and cover.
However the bad parts of the game are really bad. The game is short, it said I played 100+ hours but heres why. You get paid every Sunday but time moves slow, so slow the first time I finished the game I had only received 7 checks!  So I let the game run for hours, even overnight several days just to get paychecks. You also have to drive alot, it takes 3 real-time minutes to drive to New Jersey!  So game play is closer to 50 hours. There are only 4 vehicles. They are heavy and slow and when you hit another car you stop dead. No cool physics that let you bounce off or fly over. You just stop and have to slowly back up and go around. Everytime you exit a car you must wait for him to close the door. Even when the car is on fire and about to explode you're waiting for him to close the door before you can make him RUN.
The game is not well thought out and poorly paced. It should take longer than two months to become Don! You may kill a guy in a side mission but he will be alive to kill again in the story mission. If you start a mob war with a family and completly eliminate that family, you're STILL at war with them until you bribe an FBI agent.  (How can you be at war with people who don't exist?)  The same family you eliminate will still be talked about in the storyline because there is no cohesion. You move up the ranks by doing the story missions but even when you become Don you're still doing menial type jobs because the promotions are too fast and  completely unrelated to the other things you may be doing.
Though barbers and tailors exist in the game you cannot use them to change your clothes or appearance. You must save the game, quit the game, reload the game and then you get an option to go to the tailor or barber. When you save the game it will not default to the game you are playing so you must select it everytime. It asks, are you sure you want this file, but covers up the list so you're not really sure which file you selected.
The last drag -and there are more but hey, Ive got a life- involves the shoot mechanism. There are certain kill styles you can perform, which are cool, but theres 1 style you cant control. If you shoot someone very close to you it will start an animation that causes you to stand straight up (losing cover), grab the guy, shot him in the stomach, then the head and then finally stop. Meanwhile bad guys are blasting the heck out of you cos you are in plain sight and unable to shoot back. I have died countless times because of this and its a drag.

3.0,False,"06 13, 2011",A3AQJOBOI60CVJ,B000UW21A0,Felllix,"Uncharted: Drake's Fortune is a solid game, no doubt about it. It controls well, looks great, and the writing is above average. The series has often been called ""cinematic,"" and there's a sense in which it is; several of the sequences seem made for Hollywood, and the characters are recognizable archetypes. I mean this as an observation, not a criticism; Uncharted is Hollywood, mainstream, for better or for worse.

The game stars Nolan North as Nathan Drake, a smart-alecky treasure hunter-for-hire attempting to find the long lost treasure of his namesake, Sir Francis Drake. Following him is a journalist, Elana Fisher, voiced by Emily Rose, who insists on following him into dangerous situations for the purpose of her story. The plot of the game can best be described as low-rent Indiana Jones, with a slight bit more of the supernatural elements.

Uncharted's gameplay fluctuates between extremely light puzzle solving, Prince of Persia-style climbing and running, and very tight cover-based combat. Oh, and cutscenes. These cutscenes don't get in the way, in general, and serve to move along the gameplay between plot points. For the most part, the player is in control during chase sequences and the game provides ample opportunity for action.

Uncharted also looks great. The jungle environments are gorgeous and the facial animations and lip sync are perfect. The game is colorful as opposed to the usual grayfest of modern action games. The characters are light and cheerful, charming in their own way, and it's nice to see attempts made to move them beyond the clich&eacute;s that populate Hollywood movies like Sahara and National Treasure.

All of the elements are in place for Uncharted to be a great game; so why doesn't it achieve greatness? The problems are numerous but unmistakable; first, the cover-based combat is well-implemented but too frequent and not properly balanced. The lack of a real inventory lends the game an arcade feel for combat, but also serves to immerse the player in the feel that Drake is making up his plans as he goes along. This is a good, if shallow, idea.

The puzzles in Uncharted, I'm sorry to say, are not very good. Many of them are solved by pressing select, viewing a diagram, and then arranging pieces in a certain way. Strictly speaking, they aren't puzzles at all, since they don't involve anything for the player to solve. Again, not a criticism, only an observation.

By the same token, the Prince of Persia-style sections don't involve split-second timing or a great deal of finesse; it often feels as if Drake is being guided by the player instead of the player having an actual stake in the outcome of his actions.
Overall, I would describe Uncharted: Drake's Fortune as a solid if unspectacular game in all aspects except graphics. The game's presentation will probably be enough for most players to overlook its faults; it certainly kept me involved until the end credits. Personally, I would have preferred some real boss battles (the game has monsters, so why no big monsters?) instead of the usual enemy spamming. Despite a frustrating battle here and there, the game is also a little on the easy side.

Uncharted: Drakes Fortune is a solid beginning to what will undoubtedly be a long-running game series. The pieces is all here for something memorable and endearing, and I suspect that the second game in the series will be great. Hm.

I purchased such a copy, and it would not work.  I repaired the disk, down loaded a bunch of patches, and it still would not operate.

A few days ago I bought a new copy off Amazon from a different third party vendor, and, lo and behold, it installed and started up the first time I tried it.  So much for my negative review of the game, because I really don't have one.

I liked the first Homeworld.  It was an outstanding game, but, for whatever reason, I simply could not get into it that much because I had a lot of other games and other activities in the real world to keep me occupied.

Years later I was curious as to what people were raving about when the topic of Homeworld 2 came up.  My online gaming friend said that ""they ruined everything!""  Er, what did he mean?  I'm not too certain, but think it's largely because Homeworld 2's design changed somewhat from the previous game.  Micromanagement was not as intuitive as the previous game, and that plyer could no longer control units the way they could in the previous game.  Micromanagement of your ships and economy was reworked, and the  new story is a bit of an old trope.

The original Homeworld allowed you to control individual fighters, but Homeworld 2 did away with that.  Homeworld's construction menu was straight forward and intuitive once the player was shown the basics in the tutorial.  Homeworld 2 had a task registry as to what size and class of vessel you can research and build.  And in Homeworld 2 the economy menu is nearly always on screen.  Some of the ship classes are said to be too powerful, and an option for largest class of vessel makes you decide if you want that or something else in the game.

I don't have too many issues with the game as is.  It looks absolutely stunning on my computer.  The graphics have been given an excellent upgrade, and even on an older low end machine this game should run just fine.

Inspired by the old Stewart Cowley line of books, both Homeworld and Homeworld 2 try to capture some of the art created decades early by sci-artist greats like Peter Elson.  Both games achieve that after a fashion, and the production values for the game are simply outstanding.  But I'm having some of the same reservations now about the sequel as I did with the original, and perhaps with some of the same criticisms.

There are two things I didn't like, however.  1. When installing the Synapse utility, it forces you to register with an email address and password before unlocking the ability to adjust the settings.  This is ridiculous that I had to send my info over ""the cloud"" just to install a utility that will adjust hardware settings.  2. The left/right mouse buttons have the exact same annoying click and long travel shared with 99% of the mice on the market (they all use the same Omron supplied micro switch).

I ended up returning this for the Steelseries Rival mouse which has a much nicer tactile button feel -- much quieter and less travel resulting in less fatigue (both for someone trying to sleep in the same room, and for lengthy use).

Update -- I also tried out the new Razer Mamba Elite:

The new Razer Mamba Elite is similar to the Steelseries Rival in many ways.  They look and feel very similar, so if I was not directly looking at them I would easily get the two mixed up based on feel.  But there are three noteworthy differences:

1. The clicking sound on the Razer Mamba Elite is a bit louder and more high pitched.  I prefer the subdued clicking sound on the Steelseries Rival, because I can use that one for web browsing while someone is sleeping in the same room.  Neither are super loud like some of the Logitech mice, but Razer is a bit more audible.

2. The Razer Mambe Elite has left/right movement on the scroll wheel, and Steelseries Rival doesn't have this.

3. The Razer Mamba Elite has two buttons on the top spine, and the Steelseries Rival has one button up there.

I was introduced to this game with COD Ghosts and was expecting AW to be a whole new level of awesome. Not so much.

The Bad
- The weapons are mostly lame and/or annoying
- The jumping was cool at first but not so much now.
- The Exo abilities are weak and don't last long enough to make them worth even using.
- The maps are decent but nothing special.
- It's disappointing that you can't get the same level of customization in local play for your soldier.

The Good
- The firing range is a nice addition. Try out a weapon before equipping it.
- Some of the add-ons for weapons are decent. I like some of the new scopes in particular.
- The game still have time to bring in better maps and weapons.
- You can play ""classic mode"" that turns off the jumping.

- Playing against 8 year olds that use more profanity than a sailor.
- Overcrowded servers and gross lag. (although in some cases lag is the only way I can make a kill when playing on XBox Live).

It's campy as heck, and fun for a little while. It doesn't have much lasting value though.

In ""Monster Madness"", up to four players take the role of teenagers fighting to defend themselves against hordes of zombies and monsters. There are, accordingly, four characters - the nerd, the goth girl, the stoner, and the blonde. Each has their own special weapon, though the stages are littered with more generic improvised weapons that every player can use - furniture, power tools, guns, etc. Weapons can also be upgraded by finding tools and money in levels.

Gameplay is furious and frantic, as befits the game's style. However, it's largely definable as wading through seas of enemies in one way or another. The game is really chaotic to the point of unrecognizability, which adds to the theme of the game but detracts from actual gameplay quality. There are bright colors to distinguish players and so on, but it still largely ends up as a big muddled mess - for better or for worse. It's clear multiplayer antics are the game's main draw, though.

I already have a logitech M510, a $30 wireless mouse that has been great for most tasks, but it hasn't done as well as I'd like with games (Dragon Age Inquisition, Skyrim, Elder Scrolls Online, etc.)

Using it -- It took me a bit to get used to the new shape, but I have found it more comfortable than the Logitech M510 in my large-ish palms. It seems subjectively more responsive than the logitech during gaming. While the browser buttons feel cheap, the scroll wheel does not and all buttons have been very responsive in my experience. Overall, I'm satisfied with the performance.

Build Quality/Materials -- It's what I'd expect for the price. The mouse is made of hard, cheap-feeling plastics, and the red lights are cheesy. My logitech is much more premium feeling, with rubberized sides, and more quality plastics. However, it doesn't feel like it will break or fall apart any time soon, and the cord seems durable, so I am satisfied enough. At this price, they have to cut corners somewhere.

Conclusion -- It meets my expectations. It works well enough for how I use it, and better than my Logitech M510 does during gaming, but it definitely feels cheap. The only thing that makes up for that is the price. It is a good value, I think, but don't expect a premium-feeling product.

This creates very, very long loading times that will REALLY drive you mad. Aside from that, you'll have an absolute ton of fun with Splatterhouse.

Pros:

Great script.
Great dialogue/characters.
Nude pictures of Jennifer.
Lots of satisfying blood and gore.

It's worth buying for these two alone.

Cons:

Extremely long loading times.
Graphics are only in 720p.
Some really cheap deaths (wouldn't be such a problem if it were not for the loading times).
Seriously...the loading times are a killer. THIS GAME REALLY SHOULD HAVE INSTALLED ONTO THE PS3!!!

Nintendo has been making games for over thirty years now, and they have a legacy second to none.  As such, any product they produce must be of the highest quality, if only to live up to the hype.

The wii is a mixed bag, and only partially lives up to the positive press.

Construction wise the machine is fantastic.  I've dropped mine, knocked it over, kicked it, gotten it wet and it still works like the day I got it.  The controllers are of a similar build quality; I have abused them in a similar manner, even having a friend mistakenly throw one against the wall, and they are fine.

Beyond the construction, the Wii can be great.  Can being the optimal word.  The system definitely appeals, but to a different market then games of the last generation marketed to.  By this I mean that if you are a ""hardcore"" gamer, who revels in endless hours on the latest and greatest first person shooter (FPS), this isn't really for you.  Why do I say this?  Simple.  The games on the Wii aren't of this nature.

Most/all of the games are targeted at a much more casual group of gamers.  For Nintendo this is probably a great move, as this ""casual"" market is larger then the ""hardcore"" market, but for many of us diehard fans might consider this a bit of a let down, and if you are reading this you probably take your games seriously enough that you will want something more.  In the next few sections I'll break the Wii down a bit, so you understand exactly what you are getting if you buy it.

When you buy a Wii you get the wii itself, a Wiimote (wireless controller) and a copy of Wii Sports.  Technically there are two things that make the Wii different then the other consoles of the same generation.  First, and most importantly, it uses a non-traditional control mechanism called ""Wii Motion.""  This is a combination of infared sensors and accelerometers which allow you to ""interact"" with your games naturally.  An example is the Baseball game in Wii sports, which allows you to swing your bat by swinging the Wiimote in a swing-like motion, and causes your avatar on screen to swing his bat in the same manner.  This ""Wii Motion"" functionality is not used in every game, but it plays prominent in many; Wii specific games will doubtlessly involve some use of these mechanics, be it pointing at the screen as if you had a mouse, or shaking the Wiimote to spin Mario in a circle.  When not using such functionality the Wii controller can be used like a normal, albeit uncomfortable, controller by holding it sideways and using the traditional control pad grafted to one end.  Other games involve a secondary attachment to the Wiimote called the ""nunchuck"" which connects to the Wiimote by way of a small cord.  This also has some ""Wiimotion"" capabilities, but mostly is there for the extra buttons and a small thumb joystick.  I'd say that almost all the games I've played on the Wii, beyond the Wii Sports/Fit have involved this Nunchuck to a large extent, and if you are going to be playing a lot of games on your

Wii you will have to buy one (does not come with the Wii).

My commentary on the Wii Motion and control scheme is this.  It isn't great.  It's a gimick.  The controllers just don't allow fine enough control for most games, and they aren't really easy to use either.  Games involving Wii Motion features are mostly spent trying to figure out exactly what motion the Wii wants and then doing your best to repeat it.  This can be fun, but it isn't intuitive, and for most games it is just a pain in a neck.  Doubtlessly this is the reason many games on the Wii, including the latest Mario installation (Mario Galaxy), have almost no Wii Motion elements, and simply use the normal controller features of the Wiimote and nunchuck.  These ""normal"" features are fine.  The Wiimote-nunchuck combination is suprisingly comfortable in your hands, and control is excellent.  However, by the time you have bought both items you have basically paid $60 for one controller.  So, if you wanted the full 4 controllers you have paid: $200 for the full set.  This is compared to the $150 for 3 PS3 (or Xbox 360) controllers.  The Wii's controllers also lack a ""charge while you play"" feature.  This causes you to buy chargable batteries, or to buy lots of replacements, and the controllers do eat batteries.  Overall, I'd give the Wii's controls a mediocre rating at best.  I'd have much rather had a traditional wireless controller with good battery life, and a ""charge while you play"" feature.

Now, to give a holistic overview, we must address the Wii's software.  The Wii itself has great software.  The interface is intuitive and unobtrusive.  Updates happen very seemlessly and painlessly through the wifi, and configuration and setup is a breeze.  No one should ever complain about the Wii's interface, especially compared to the obnoxious layered menu system of the xbox 360, or the large tree of options presented by the ps3.  However, the system's interface isn't what usually interests users, so much as the games themselves.

The Wii's games...  Before I continue I want to make a small point about the Wii.  It is a hardware concern that I didn't mention above, but it really effects the games produced.  This concern is the fact that Wii is not much of a performance increase over the gamecube.  The result are graphics that are not as visually stunning and those found on the PS3 or Xbox 360.  Also of note is that the Wii does not provide true HD video, but merely some upscaled 480p.  These combined attributes are definitely a major factor in the sad truth about Wii games, which is that they are not cutting edge installments with the best graphics and the hottest gameplay.  Every game I've played for Wii has been one of a few

categories.  1) Gimicky use of the Wii Motion.  2) A Nintendo produced rehashing of one of their key franchises (Mario, Zelda).  3) A port from another console.

I'll expand on this categories with examples:
1) examples: Wii Sports, Wii Fit, Wii Sports Resort
  These consist of a bunch of mini games centered around use of the Wii Motion Capabilities.  Fun, but mostly just a gimicky display of a neat technology.  These are the most fun to play with others.  So I'd consider them a ""party"" game.
2) examples: Mario Galaxy, Mario Kart Wii, Zelda Twilight Princess
  Great games, worthly sucessors to the franchises, and the closest to targeting the ""hardcore"" market on the Wii.  Still, they are basically status quo for nintendo.  Don't expect anything magical with these.
3) Port
  Gamecube games updated and released, or virtual console games (emulated games from other systems --genesis, snes, nes, ect-- on the Wii)
  This category is great, and a saving grace, in my opinion.  I've spent probably half my time on the Wii playing virtual console games, but they are costly, ($5-$15 a pop)  and not original content.

These categories pretty much describe ALL games I've seen for the Wii.  I'd summerize by saying that the Wii has little ""original"" content, and  does not a vast library of games.  Games on it are fun, but they are gimicky party games to play with your friends.  It is a sad sad truth, but I'd say that the Wii is basically a gimped system, stuck with its core contigency of status quo items (Zelda, Mario, Metroid) and with little to no third party development going on.

I suggest the Wii for anyone who wants one of these few things: A bunch of Gimicky party games. More of Nintendo's staple fair, such as Mario. OR a never ending supply of old nintendo classics for download (costs money).

Do NOT buy the Wii if you want a modern gaming experience with all the bells and whistles.

I want to clarify before I end this review.  The Wii is a great system.  There is nothing better, in my mind, the bashing each other in a rousing game of Mario Kart or Smash Brothers.  The virtual console is also a great feature, and has created many nostalgia filled hours for me.  That said, be aware that in many ways it is technologically inferior to its siblings AND it isn't really as cheap as it claims to be, due to the cost of all the necessary accessories.

If you don't care about having the latest and greatest and want something you can sit down with for a few minutes here and there (and have a great time with) the Wii is the system for you.

3.0,False,"11 17, 2008",A22N1KHTXT5ZWL,B001APM444,Richard H.,"Short Conclusion First:  Rent it first, see how you like.

On to the review, I really liked the Gamecube version.  The game had endurance in it, still play it.  Super Slugger doesn't.  The Wii-ness of the game is simple, but fulfilling enough.  Throwing, running, batting are well done.  I should say base running takes some time to get used to.  Their choice of how to control base runners is logical, however, not necessarily how you will be used to controlling base runners.  Also in Toy Field, playing aggressively is a little different as well.. not as logical.  You need to press B to hit a person.  In other games a simple nunchuck shake would do that.  Don't know why they went that route.

The big disappointment from a single player perspective is the Challenge portion of the game.  The ""Challenge"" portion of the game is quite juvenile and lacks any desire to continue on with it, once beaten (and it is real easy to beat).  The Challenge seems more interested in training you into how to play the game (they already have well done tutorials) than for you to actually play a game.  You only play Bowser's and Bowser Jr's team, instead of a bunch of teams as with the Gamecube game.  You run around, do remedial tasks and even a little puzzle solving in order to make your team grow instead of earning players as per the Gamecube version.

The Mini-games play well.  Some changes from the old Gamecube version mini-games help make this game familiar, but unique.  Toy Field is rebuilt and different (would have been nice to have the classic Toy Field as well), but certainly fun.  You can play with teams of 2 if you like.  The game play in Toy Field is much more straight forward than in the Baseball game itself.

Sadly, the big trouble with the game is the multi-player and fielding control.  The game becomes very frustrating when it comes to controlling your fielders, both in single and especially in multi-player mode.  In single-player, sometimes the wrong player is selected to get an in-field hit.  For instance take a hit between 1st and 2nd, the game will have you controlling the 1st baseman, making an out much more difficult than quickly running the 2nd baseman to get the ball and throw.  Another situation would be a hit that an in-fielder could dive and grab, but the game has given you control of the outfielder!  By the time you know who you have control of, it may be too late to get the out.

In multi-player, you can field at the same time, but what team member is being controlled by what player is almost impossible to know from the beginning, making tough fielding plays very difficult.

To conclude, the game could have been much better.  The single player draw is very limited.  The game will only remain fun as a multi-player game.  And playing a game between two people, instead of sharing the same team, can be and is fun.  The mini-games are fun, as is Toy Field.  Ultimately, you may find the fielding too frustrating.  As I said earlier, rent this one first and get a good feel for the game.  I feel that the Gamecube version, while less Wii-ish, is much more fun and less frustrating to play over the long-term.","Potentially fun, but a frustrating disappointment",1226880000,26,,
3.0,True,"09 21, 2011",A36NSXEFUPBTI3,B002I0K7ZI,Peachy Fox,"My first introduction to Suda51 was Shadows of the Damned. I really enjoyed the quirky, adult humor and characters of that game. It also made me want to try one of his most well known games, No More Heroes. It's quite interesting reading the reviews for the PS3 version, because the majority of people who have played the original Wii version don't sound all too impressed with this copy of the game. As for me being an individual who never played the original, I can definitely say it was one of the more enjoyable PS3 games I've had pleasure to experience, simply due to the fun factor. Shadows of the Damned was ""ok"" and cute (yes, you read that correctly, I said cute), but I didn't enjoy it as much as NMH. In No More Heroes, the story is cheesey, completely dumb and waaaaay over-the-top. That may sound like a negative to some people, but I found it works so well in this. It's like if Quentin Tarantino suddenly became obsessed with Star Wars one day and decided to make a game, only to reference it like crazy. The story, gameplay, side missions and bosses in No More Heroes never got old for me, even after three playthroughs. The upscaled graphics I thought looked nice as well.

I did run into quite a few screen tearing issues and glitches (DLC Saber/Mine Mission, Bike getting stuck next to objects), but those are little things and not really game breaking.

I have to begin by admitting that EA has done an admirable job with the overall gameplay and franchise mode despite the flaws. The commentary however stinks. Cris Collinsworth is terribly annoying and Tom Hammond is droll at best. I never thought I would desperately miss John Madden's syllogisms this badly.

As for the gameplay itself, running the ball is still too difficult with halfbacks and too easy with quarterbacks. Receivers can run way out of bounds and return to make the catch, with no penalty being called or issues. You can constantly convert on 4th down, literally 99% of the time if it's within 2-3 yds. Offensive Linemen frequently give up on blocks. Quarterbacks constantly fumble on QB sneaks. There is no long distance passing game either, no matter who your QB or WR is. TE's are still too good. The receiver spotlight feature almost never works. The CPU never seems to miss a field goal. Kicks are almost never blocked, I've only seen one in over 40 games. The volume of problems such as these turns what would be an easy 98 overall rating into a 75 or 80.

The new ""fairness feature"" is also very controversial. It essential puts a beginner with the Falcons on even footing with an expert player using the all-time 72 Dolphins. The expert player's teammates will randomly fumble, drop passes etc to compensate for the beginner's lack of skill. This is personally offensive to me and robs skilled players of a true advantage. The idea was obviously designed to get more beginners to purchase the game, marketing at its worst.

Franchise mode is apparently unchanged from 2008, but is still excellent. The graphics are good, but not revolutionary. Manual juking and catching is well done. The lead blocking option is also very functional and pretty easy to use. Special Teams are well handled but it's impossible to return kicks for touchdowns. One glaring issue is that kick power is diluted. Kickers with 99 kick power will often come up short on 50 yarders. Edit: I'm referring to ALL-MADDEN level of difficulty in this review.

However the setting, the feel, the way they tell the story, all feel really good.  That's the high point of Alan Wake.  The story was enough to get me through the game, and have a decent time with it.

Alan Wake's biggest problem is the way it plays, and the endless forest sections of the game that have you on a fixed path.  Time and time again the same enemies jump out at you, you fight them, rinse and repeat.  You fight the same battle, against pretty much the same enemies, in forests that all feel the same, time after time after time, from the beginning of the game until the end.  It gets really old.

To make matters worse, the controls feel off, and the combat mechanic feels goofy too.  So the worst part of the game is the shooting and the forest corridors, and it's what you'll spend most of your time doing in this game.  The parts where you're indoors feel great and are interesting, but those sections aren't a big part of the game.

This game left me wanting for what I had hoped it would be when I first saw it several years ago.  This game and Fable II were the two games (unreleased at the time) that convinced me I need an XBox 360, and both were a huge letdown to me.  I'm VERY glad I bought a 360 though, as there are plenty of great games that have kept me more than satisfied with the system.  It's just too bad that the two I was most excited for turned out to be duds.

I read a reviewer that said that Alan Wake was like the first Uncharted, a good foundation which lead to Uncharted 2, which is one of the best games of this gen.  I'm not sure I agree with that.  I think Uncharted one's core game mechanics were fun, as well as having a superb story, it just lacked some technical polish and a bit of variety.  Alan Wake has the technical polish down, and the story down, but they have a long ways to go in terms of designing levels, and core gameplay mechanics.  I'd still love to see an Alan Wake 2, but they need to go back to the drawing board and spice the level design up, and make the core mechanics of the game feel better.  If you're going to have people shooting a gun through most of the game, it had better feel right, and satisfying.

First of all, the actual name should be something like ""Knights of the Old Mass Effect"" or ""Mass Effect of the Old Republic"", because it's almost a complete redo of the KOTOR games down to a lot of small details. A group of galactic peacekeepers/police? Not Jedis, rename them 'Spectres' and yep, you've got them. A trusted and powerful Jedi/Spectre who turns evil and tries to conquer the galaxy with a super-powerful spaceship? Yep, got that too. An overwhelming evil that threatens all life? Yep. Jedi powers? Rename them 'Biotic' effects and yep, there they are. Same squad-type setup, same basic aliens just tweaked slightly (and REALLY non-imaginatively, they're all just basic humanoids who don't even act like aliens - it's the Star Trek method of putting a ridge on a forehead and BOOM! Hey, it's an alien!), potential romances with various party members, on and on and on. It was deja-vu all over again!

I found even the level designs surprisingly disappointing and LAZY - every spaceship you enter, every mine, every underground complex all have the EXACT SAME layout! I mean come on, is it REALLY too much to ask a supposedly 'next gen' game to have unique layouts for different areas??

And a major part of the game is incredibly annoying - the tank like 'MAKO' which you're forced to drive all over super-rugged planet terrains handles like a shopping cart with a busted wheel, and hello bad camera angles. Trying to get from Point A to Point B on these planets is an exercise in frustration and boredom, again NOT what you'd expect from a Next-Gen game with so much hype.

The original Street Fighter 2, Champion Edition, and Hyper Fighting are nowhere to be found. The result is a shallow package that should have been so much more. The graphics and gameplay in the Super games are almost identical to what you remember. Every frame of original animation appears intact, and there isn't any noticeable slowdown. However, the graphics do appear a bit fuzzy. The sound is decent, and the music even speeds up and intensifies when a character is near death. The second disc contains Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold. The game is almost entirely identical to Street Fighter Alpha 2, with only a few differences. First, any character that was in Street Fighter 2 Champion Edition can switch between normal and Champion Edition modes. Playing a CE version of a character disables his super meter and changes a few moves here and there. The CE character graphics are still Alpha 2-style.

You travel all over the land of Nippon (which is Japanese for ""Japan""; how original) fighting monsters, helping people, and healing nature of the curse of evil. The story is nothing new, and is both very linear and quite predictable. But it is very well done, mixing japanese mythology into a classic hero story, with a generous helping of humor to give it flavor.

The story has one major downside, though: it is told through cut scenes that contain bucket-loads of exposition. You will often find yourself button-mashing X desperately to try to speed things along, and that does not work very well because the important cut scenes don't let you speed up the dialogue. For instance, the very first cut scene that opens the game literally takes at least 15 minutes to get through before you can get to the action. Most of the rest are not nearly that long, but several of them do take a good 5 minutes at least. To say that it gets tedious is an understatement.

Still, the cell-shaded graphics largely make up for the tedious cut scenes. They are done in a very beautiful, yet simplistic style that evokes a traditional Japanese ink painting. Despite the simple style, though, the level of detail is outstanding. In fact, it is so detailed that there is the occasional spot of graphical slowdown. This game really pushes the hardware of the PS2 to its limits.

The music and sound are also fantastic. Most of the music evokes traditional Japanese art as much as the graphics do, while the sound effects range from wolf barks and footfalls to wind blowing gently through trees, and more. The mood is always set perfectly for whatever environment you're visiting.

Except, possibly, with the voices. Rather than real voices, people talk in a form of gibberish that sounds like someone trying to talk underwater. While it does not bother me personally, some people simply can not listen to these voice effects. Either you'll hate the voice noises with a passion, or you won't care at all. Either way, this is not a good point for the game.

The controls take a bit of getting used to, but when you have gotten used to them they become second nature. Unlike the ""Legend of Zelda"" games, there is no enemy lock-on during combat. Instead, you automatically target the closest monster(s) when you push the attack button. This simplifies combat without turning it into a button-mashing cake walk. It works perfectly...unless you get hit by the controller bug.

Yes, a *bug* in the game. Thankfully rare, as I only encountered it twice in 60+ hours of game play. Still, when it happens it is extremely annoying. During combat, while you're wailing away on a monster, the options-menu will suddenly open for no reason. Usually, the analog control on your controller will also go crazy, either just turning off or madly flickering on and off. Either case makes the game impossible to play, of course, since you control your in-game avatar with the left analog stick. The first case is easy to fix; just turn the analog control back on and exit the menu. In the second case, you can only fix it by literally unplugging the controller and then plugging it back in.

Far more common than the controller bug are the load times. They usually are not terrible, but it seems like a loading screen comes up at least every five minutes or so. Between these and the long cut-scenes, you might sometimes wonder if there is actually any game play included.

But there *is* game play, and it is a lot of fun. There is a great deal to keep you occupied, from the compelling story line to the many treasure hunts, races, puzzles, and mini-games. Between fighting to save the world, you can go fishing, feed animals, catch thieves, and a lot more. Plus, after you beat the game once it unlocks lots of extras, including image galleries and the sound track. All of that and the wonderful atmosphere definitely make this a game worth checking out. Rent it before you buy it, if possible, to make sure you can deal with the long cut scenes, numerous load times, and weird voice effects. But if you are a fan of action RPGs like ""Legend of Zelda"", you will definitely want to add Okami to your game library.

The game carries penalties for being too violent, but as long as the bad guys shoot first, you're free to go on a violent shooting spree. The game also doesn't require a lot of stealth, or allow a lot of stealth really even when you try to be quiet.
You only get one violent weapon per mission, and you really don't even need the other non-lethal weapons on each mission I think, because so many of the missions are so straightforward and linear...and very short.

To be fair, I didn't think this game would be that good ever since the first time I heard the commercial with that stupid song. But this isn't about a commercial, this is about the game.

Good:
-Co-op: It's pretty easy to drop in/out of a friends/enemies/complete strangers game. My one complaint is that when you first connect, it seems to take a little longer to load than some other games. However, once you're in, everything plays great.
-Environment: The game world seems pretty expansive from what I've played so far.
-Explosions: There are lots of pretty explosions to be had. Plus, I like how they've done calling in airstrikes and such, where you need to find the pick-ups in world and not just be limited by the amount of cash you have.

Bad:
-Explosions: While there are lots of things you can blow up, it seems like every single building I've destroyed has blown up the same way with the same animation. The sides blow out, and then the roof collapses, and then...destroyed building. There's no halfway destroyed buildings, where a wall is blown through but the roof is still up.
-Graphics: For as much as this game costs new, I'd expect some great graphics. Unfortunately, this is not the case. In the very first cutscene, my character (Chris, the black guy) looked like an ink blot for the first half of the scene. A giant, man-shaped ink blot. When I'm talking to someone, he just stands there in a way that no one would ever stand for long periods of time (where his arm has a 90 degree angle, like sticking someone up at gunpoint at close range). And then he doesn't move...just stands there. Plus, everybody is surrounded by a glow in the cutscenes...there own personal auras if you will.
-Bugs: I'll be honest here and say that I haven't played for a long time so far, so I don't have a giant list of bugs. But in the small time I have played, I've encountered a enough to know that this game should not have been shipped the way it was. At times, it seems like the pickups that you encounter in the world are being swallowed up by the ground. You'll see the icon, but the graphic for what's there will be under the ground. Another one I've seen (which I guess would be along the same lines) is when doing the winch challenges. My friend and I were playing around, and he flew the helicopter as high as possible. Once there, he dropped the package. Fun times...until I go to put the package on top of the shipping containers and the package is stuck under the map. I'd try and winch it, but it just acted like an anchor until I let go. Needless to say, I lost money on that challenge.
-Draw-in: Along with graphics, there is an INSANE amount of draw-in. During those winch challenges, I would be flying the helicopter and be a little over the top of the building and guess what? I couldn't see the shipping containers on the ground. Not until I descended and got closer would they appear. I know if I'm in a helicopter, a giant shipping container would be clear as day on the ground if I'm only 20 ft over top of it. Also, in the world of Mercs 2, you're characters are near sighted. Seeing anything more than maybe 15 feet in front of you is beyond you're control.

Added 9/14/08
-Saving/Loading: This game has an autosave function as well as a manual save function. Pretty standard in most games nowadays. Thing is, there's no load option...anywhere, except to continue from last save. If you somehow mess up and want to try again, you have to quit the game and do the continue option from the main menu. Hopefully you didn't autosave after you manually saved, or your manual save isn't worth anything anymore.

So, there it is. Would I buy this game? Sure, for $20, but not at a $60 price point. Meanwhile, if I want some Mercs action, I'll pop Mercenaries in and play that.",Oh no you didn't...,1221177600,4,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},
3.0,True,"05 10, 2003",A15UXO3PDUOGJY,B00005YVTX,Ironblayde,"Kain finally returns in Blood Omen 2, but this latest installment in the series is missing some of what made the first Legacy of Kain such an enjoyable game.
Gameplay is very straightforward. Kain must progress through the world of Nosgoth by killing his enemies and solving puzzles. This is where some of the problems come in. Combat is all right, but Kain has very few options available to him. Attack, block, grab, and that's it. Occasionally you can use a Dark Gift (more on that in a minute) in battle, but it's nothing more than a stronger attack. Boss battles are usually more interesting, but in general, combat leaves something to be desired. The puzzles in the game are all very simple, and so they get tedious. Finally, the game is linear in the extreme. There is never a time when you can deviate from the path and explore a little; you're always on the one, pre-set course through the game.
Kain also has a number of Dark Gifts at his disposal, which he collects throughout the game. These can be pretty interesting. For example, you can change into mist (if there is mist present) and sneak past guards, or kill them stealthily, instantly. You can make insanely long jumps from one rooftop to another, like you'd see in The Matrix. You can control NPCs and force them to do your will. This is good stuff, but I wish there had been more of a focus on it, and that Kain had more varied abilities. The first Blood Omen had more variety.
Graphically, the game is fairly good. The atmosphere of Nosgoth is conveyed very well; it's definitely not a place you'd want to live, and it shows in the scenery, the ambient sound effects, and the bits of overheard conversation. The character models (other than Kain) seem relatively basic. There are some clipping problems as well. All in all, the graphics could be better for the XBox version of this game. They're decent, and get the job done, but it's not a game you'd use to show off the graphical power of the XBox.
The cutscenes in the game are top-notch. The first Blood Omen featured some of the best voice acting you could find on the PSX, and the quality does not disappoint here either. Plus, Kain is such a cool character, you look forward to seeing him interact with the other characters in the game (aside from drinking their blood, that is).
Ultimately, the game's many good points can't completely make up for the often-repetitive gameplay. Nosgoth is a fascinating world, and Kain a fun character to play, but the game can get boring at times, and with its very strict linearity, replay value is virtually zero. It's definitely worth a purchase, since you can now buy this at about half its original price (or less), but the first Blood Omen was the superior game.","A good game, though the first Blood Omen was better",1052524800,4,,

3.0,True,"08 28, 2015",A1S5QVS3YLY6FK,B00CMC6HZ6,TW,"I hadn't played a wrestling game since SD vs. Raw 2010. I also haven't followed wrestling for awhile. My son watches a few of the programs each week, but most of what I saw wasn't very interesting. I grew up with the 80s Saturday night wrestling shows with Gordon Solie as announcer, Sunday was WWF/E and even rented the VHS of Wrestlemania I just a few months after it originally happened. I really loved wrestling. Our son is back and forth with it. So there's really not been a reason to buy the games. I hadn't realized 2K had taken over the WWE series until a few weeks ago. That, if nothing else, made me interested in the game since I believe 2K still has developed the best NFL game ever ... in NFL 2K5. And I've enjoyed several of the more current NBA 2K games.

The roster had very little impact on my choice of which WWE game to get. Despite being a fan during the 80s and through the Attitude Era, I'm not really into using the wrestlers from those eras, especially those who've passed away. I was more interested in having a fun game. Everything I read on wrestling games forums said 2K14 is better than 2K15, so I ordered a used version, not knowing I would need to buy an online pass since the one included was used by the previous owner.

So, I ended up paying ten more dollars for an online pass. Then ended up buying the Season Pass which was another twenty dollars. I really didn't mind the price since I figured it would be enough to last my wrestling game interest for a few years. The game is good, but it's really not that different than I remember the THQ WWE games being. It's a reversal-fest. I ended up lowering the reversal slider all the way down to just one level of it. It was pretty annoying to hit a finisher, pick the guy up and have him reverse your next move. There's plenty of match types to play. And though the roster didn't matter much to me in the beginning, it started to matter once I played the game. I ended up going to the community creations and downloading roughly 90 created wrestlers since there's a lot of active wrestlers not in this game. I would think most notably for current WWE fans, The Wyatt Family. There's some really great created wrestlers in the community creations.

We played it off and on for a week or so, but the roster, even with added created wrestlers, just isn't very good. The best created wrestlers don't look much better than the worst default characters. I would rate this higher, but I turned around and bought a new copy of WWE 2K15 for the 360 and liked it quite a bit better. I wouldn't rate either one a five star. There's problems in these games that were around back in 2010. From collision detection, floating wrestlers, a very ambitious ""create a finisher"" that ends up making you think they really don't put much time into it. Create a Story isn't any better than I remember it being. It more or less reminds me of most sports video games. They update the roster, throw a few new animations in and say it's a new game. I'm also going to review 2K15 as well. A quick ending piece of advice. Only buy used if you're willing to pay the money for the online access which you have to have to download created wrestlers. You also have to have Xbox Gold. I tried a free trial week to the online access only to find out it wouldn't let me download any created wrestlers during the trial. If you buy a new copy it will come with the online access code. One last warning on this one. The server has been having problems for the last 2 weeks.

Essentially, you have 12 playable charachters with slightly different abilities (better at sneaking/sniping/medical/etc) to choose from, you choose 4 per mission and can control each of the 4 one at a time in a first or third person view.  While you control one the computer controls the others and this can be both good (the computer can see so much better than you) or bad (little to no AI).  The weapons are authentic enough for this type of game and everything looks really good.

Not only are the developers spitting in the eye of deaf gamers, they're also annoying all the people (like me) that may not have the game on blast while they're playing it. In fact, even when I did turn it up to try to figure out what was going on, the voices were very muffled and hard to understand. Because of this, I just ended up muting the game completely and ignoring the story, which actually may have improved the experience. As far as I can tell, the people ordering you around like their gopher aren't who they say they are, and they've had you going back in time to change the future for various nefarious reasons. There's nothing you can do to change anything, and the only real choice you have is who to kill at the very end (here you can even go back to the last save and try out the different endings I believe) the story seems to be just very linear and convoluted. It was also a bit annoying that there isn't any sort of final boss, the ending is more similar to Fable 2.

As for the actual gameplay, it works very well and is similar in my mind to a combination of Bulletstorm, Call of Duty, and Fear. It's classic first person shooting (CoD), with a bunch of crazy weapons (Bulletstorm), a shifting disturbing environment (Fear) and uses the classic health packs instead of the modern regenerating health. The human AI isn't too intelligent, but some of the monsters could be very annoying, with very high attacks that can kill you in a few hits, they also like to flank you. Also, there are these flood-like creatures that would swarm and then explode when they're near, they weren't too difficult to kill with a shotgun, but they were incredibly annoying especially in areas where you can't put a wall behind your back. There are some cool bosses, but they all use the cliche glowing weakspot that you see in every game. The health system works pretty well once it's upgraded, it's an example of how a system other than magical regeneration can work in a shooter. The save points in the game were ok, but much too often they sent you back too far after a spot that was obviously going to cause lots of people to die. There were also some very annoying points when you're trying to save an NPC, and multiple times right before I hit a save-point it would be game over because I stopped to grab some ammo/health/collectibles. It was ridiculous.

Here's what worked for me:

Assuming your system meets the minimum requirements then,
1. Make sure ALL of your drivers are up to date.
2. Download all SEVEN patches for the game.
3. Install the game then ALL SEVEN PATCHES in sequence.
One of the patches removes the ""Rock Star Social Club"" requirement.
4. DO NOT overclock your CPU. This was the show stopper for me.
It kept causing WIN XP to BSOD. Something with the NVIDIA driver
going into an infinite loop. Running my CPU at stock speed corrected this.
Overclocking was not a problem with other game titles on my system.
5. ""Securom"". Deal with it as you see fit. Solutions are out there.
6. As for ""Windows Live"" just create an offline account. Problem solved.
7. Now you have to play with your graphics card settings both directly and
in-game till you find the happy balance that works for your system.

Even after doing all this there are still glitches, Occasional briefly missing textures,
occasional brief sound stuttering and other minor but annoying anomalies.
At least it runs now without crashing or taking WIN XP down with it.

Aside from the headaches of installing and configuring it to run and the glitches
It is a fun game. The storyline and missions are good, The graphics are nice,
The vehicles handle O.K. There's various ""side missions"" to do. BIG map to play with.
Plenty of ""MODS"" available, (I haven't tried any yet outside of a ""trainer"" to cheat with,
There are cheat codes that you type into your in-game cell phone but the trainer makes
it easier and gives you more options.)

Overall, If you liked the earlier GTA games this one is worth getting, (Wait till it's on sale. I did,)
And now that I'm familiar with the problems I'll probably get ""Episodes from Liberty City"" when
the price drops.

If GTA V is released for P.C. I do hope that Rock Star Games addresses issues like these before hand

3.0,True,"07 14, 2017",A1VC7DQHCGRD4E,B017S3OPZM,Kyle Kyle Kyle,"Some things to be aware of prior to purchasing this game-
-Anime dialogue and tropes, like the ""tch"" noise and ""sighs"" and ""ehs"" of the females you hear in animes are all in this. If you don't like teen anime you will not get absorbed into this game
-Dialogue is stilted and the glorious rave reviews you read come heavily from NieR and anime fans, rather than the general gaming community
-Only the first and ""possibly"" the 3rd playthrough is with 2B (NieR's hot babe protagonist). 9s is a pedophiles dream. I found it very comfortable playing as him
-Being intentionally vague so I don't get flagged, it ought to be said that the Japanese culture saturates this game, so if you don't like men that look like women, or women who are hookers or little boys in tight leather make you feel itchy I would not recommend this game
-2B's best attack explodes her skirt off and you are forced to run around in a thong. The boy 9s loses his skivvs as well, which is really awkward. You'd think there would be a non-pervert-pedo option for the Western version, given our culture's hatred of children in even mildly sexual themes

STORY
The story itself was unsatisfying but not bad, and although the combat was very fun it became repetitive and it was very easy on normal but hard was CRUSHING. Even on normal there were some severe difficulty spikes in boss battle phases, where you rip a boss hard for the first 25% of his life, then rip him again phase 2 and then final phase you can get 2-shot very VERY fast as most enemies in this game can hit multiple times almost instantly. Other than that I really breezed through the game. This is more of an afterthought to be aware of.

Don't expect much reward for leveling yourself and your weapons because the game is about 6 hours if you run through and then you must play as 9s. I found only a couple of the weapons I bought and painstakingly upgraded usable by him. And then your levels scale anyway, so there also no feeling of being overpowered if you actually took the time to hit higher levels on your first play. The villains are staight-up lame. They are so melodramatic! I've watched hundreds of anime, and I still own and love Hellsing, Akira, One Punch Man, Cowboy BeBop and all those amazing 90s punk rocker anime tropes and butt kickers with silly, lame dialogue, awesome action, quiet powerful heroes like Vampire Hunter D, you get the point... this game was almost unbearable. It's also hard to take it seriously when 2B's butt and crotch are in high contrast white-black in that skin-tight dominatrix leather outfit. Story is at best a 6 or 7 out of 10 unless you love teen melodrama anime. And for those who bring up the philosphizing in this game, I'm equally sad to say the ""philosophy"" in this game is barely the Philosophy 101 class you slept through in college. Some of it might edge on Philosphy for dummies. If you love Ghost in the Shell...prepare for severe disappointment. That anime was like philosophy for professors compared to this ""for dummies"" version.

Note to Gamers unfamiliar with Japanese games- games like Dark Souls and NieR seems to reach extremely high appeal but so much of it is from what appears to be a western fanbase of ""all that is Japanese culture"" rather than ""all that is excellent."" You will find that the fanbase is extremely verbose in raves while different gamers such as myself who only dive in here and there become confused as to what all the hubub is. I found that Dark Souls was supremely overrated but it's one of the best games I've played for other reasons, which I found I was lucky that I took the chance. So I took the chance on NieR as well, but was somewhat disappointed. You will see many 5-star reviews but remember 95% of them are from fans and very few are from gamers who are not already neck-deep in Japanese culture

GRAPHICS
The graphics are actually flat out terrible. AWFUL. They belong to a PS2 with some PS3 visuals like volumetric lighting. The color palette for this game is grey. Everything is grey. I actually had to google why the game was greyed but that is the style and your TV is not broken nor will adjusting it help.

Textures are ALL blurred, there is heavy aliasing probably because even on PS4 it is not 1080p, it's 900p30FPS, and one of the reasons why I bought NieR on PS4 instead of my 4K PC gaming rig was because I wanted a stable framerate more than better graphics. Sadly even on PS4 the game jerks all over the place. The framerate drops so often on this graphical terd that I believe it is an extreme indication of complete sloth on the developers part and a true indication of the state of gaming quality for this gen. This is not a AAA game developer so I cut it some slack but this is seriously a PS2 game, there is no reason for this! For a game that has PS2 graphics this is totally unacceptable and migraine inducing.

The PC version is a mess. It simply doesn't work. People with GTX 1080's like me and i7-6800 series CPU's are barely holding 1080p60FPS and the game has a 900p60FPS graphics cap to boot for PC and 900p30FPS on PS4. PC versions require a mod to even go past  1080p60FPS at all, but no one really can anyway without 4x 1080ti's and a 5960X. It's crazy that by patch 1.06 on PS4 that this version is a stuttering mess still (but DLC is out!) and the PC version has had one DLC but no patches at all, as far as I'm aware of (July 14th 2017). A true indication that this studio could not or would not care after sales are final.

COMBAT
-As I've seen from other sites from people like me who were surprised that the game was very far from the hype we all hear, I found the combat to be very fun for a few hours but it quickly tapered off. All the weapons of each class attack the same, so all spears are the same and all small swords are the same and all large swords are the same, etc... I did find some variety by switching weapons from light attack slot to the heavy to change up their attack for more tactical use, like mob clear speed via sweeping, slow attacks vs faster single enemy attacks. Switching weapon positions also changes HOW both weapons interact with each other when you decide to combine light and heavy attacks with your two equipped weapons. So a light attack may do one thing as a SQUARE SQUARE SQUARE SQUARE, then do something totally different with SQUARE TRIANGLE or TRIANGLE SQUARE. Then you can try to combine them with some timing. Plus, the evasions you can perform are very cool and there's some decent customizations, enough to say that the combat was a high focus of the game. The biggest downside is that you will notice the enemies are so stupid, so dumb, and all the same. You are not fighting the Soul of Cinder on Dark Souls 3 nor Hades from God of War (so cool!), and definitely not Sephiroth or Ultimecia in Final Fantasy 7 and 8. You will spend every one of your plays fighting silly, anime trope robot enemies with chibi faces and then you will fight androgenous female-males named Adam and Eve (my jaw dropped with how [insert non-PC three letter word here starting with G] they were lol). I'd actually think that fighting moogles from Final Fantasy 9 would have been much more horrifying than boo-hooing topless boy-girl-men. Nevermind Adam and StEve lol

MUSIC
Both  fantastic and grating. Some of the music and text based dialogue is a throw-back to the PS1/PS2 days, which I didn't find offensive or lazy but I did find myself with an urge to mash ""O"" to get through it all. It was the music that hit me sour because it has WORDS more than anything that started to kill my experience. Do not expect operatic overtures that pump your blood, it's melancholic J-Pop music which is extremely well done but when you are grinding an area for an extended period for levels or upgrade materials the WORDS destroy the otherwise great music. A song with words that is 2 minutes is traumatic after you hear the same words 30x. This music is not ""good repetitive"" like you expect from Diablo 2 when you grind the Tristram area (google that song, it's amazing, 12 years later and I still listen to it). It's like listening to Japanese N-Sync, it hits the spot but then suffocates you eventually. I must stress the music is amazing, but songs with words for an RPG was possibly the worst idea I've ever encountered. But the fact it took me to hear the same song 50x before I started to mentally meltdown shows how great the music is, but it was a poor fit.

The game tries way too hard to be emotional. It's too fast in story to ever connect to the characters to your heart. Nothing really happens in the first playthrough so right off the bat you must LOVE the game to keep going. It will end and you'll be like.....wha? Seriously? Worst part is the other plays only have minor differences, so if you're like me and the milk is sour then prepare to drink more of that sour milk and hope there might be more to it. So I felt it was necessary to throw out one poor review of a game I found mostly enjoyable for combat but lacking in every other conceivable aspect. This game is graciously given a 6/10 by me.

3.0,False,"03 27, 2014",A25XBY1L1JEDLQ,B00EM5UFEK,Debasish Majumder,"Changing genres mid-franchise is a tough sell, especially when you're taking a popular series and saying ""screw it, we're making it a shooter!"" Popcap's Plants vs. Zombies is the latest to make the leap, and arguably the strangest example yet; Garden Warfare outright ditches the tactical gameplay of the original for large-scale multiplayer gunfights. No longer are you planting Bonk Choy and standing back as it clobbers zombies--you're in the thick of it, firing peas from your pea shooter mouth and sniping zombies with the Cactus's long-range shots. And though there are some strange design decisions and balance issues, the resulting shooter is charming, enjoyable, and wholly worthy of the Plants vs. Zombies name.

Whereas the PvZ of the past was a lightweight tower defense series, Garden Warfare is a class-based third-person shooter, with plants and zombies going to war in suburban areas with guns, seeds, rockets, and petals. It's a much more action-oriented experience, obviously, but the core of the franchise--the delightful struggle between plants and zombies--is pleasantly intact, and held up by strong core gameplay that's enjoyable in its lunacy.

Garden Warfare lacks a single-player campaign of any kind, instead doubling down on a trio of cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes. Each dips into the same five rural levels, repurposed to scratch a different multiplayer itch, and though none are all that outstanding, they're enjoyable in their own right. Vanquish (Team Deathmatch) and Gardens & Graveyards (Control Point/Rush Mode) are polished and engaging, and take advantage of the idiosyncrasies of the PvZ universe in 12-on-12 battles. While Vanquish doesn't deviate from the team deathmatch archetype, G&G allows the vegetation side to defend its points with potted plants, while the zombies can spawn undead AI to help swarm the enemy's gardens. This minor change makes the already large-scale battles feel even more massive, and gives you additional control over the mayhem.

Garden Ops flies closest to traditional Plants vs. Zombies gameplay, with a team of four plants fighting off increasingly difficult waves of zombies and battling the occasional boss wave. Sure, it's just Gears' increasingly prevalent Horde mode, but the premise translates perfectly into the PvZ universe. Though it lacks the scale of the 24-player skirmishes, the more intimate setup and focus on co-op make for engaging gameplay--and the ability to fortify your base with potted plants is a clever tip of the hat to the franchise's roots (pun not intended but, wow, that worked out well). Each multiplayer level has a few locations to start the waves from, too, making up for the otherwise paltry list of multiplayer maps.

The Plant and Zombie factions each feature four unique, playable classes, and they all come with a trio of special abilities that help them stand out. While there are some that are blatantly better than the rest, they all have their own place on the battlefield--from the high-damage Zombie All-Star (who can kick explosive zombies, dash, and spawn tackling dummies) to the healing Sunflower (who can fire beams of solar light when she's not healing her allies). There's a good deal of asymmetry to it as well, creating a fun dynamic between the sides and making for chaotic bouts. It also lends itself to some balance problems--good luck finding anything as powerful as the one-hit-kill Chomper on the zombie side. Seriously, that guy's a dick.

These eight classes (and the ability to customize them) is the most surprisingly deep part of Garden Warfare, and adds depth to the otherwise lightweight shooter. Every character has cosmetic slots that can be outfitted with a number of items, letting you don sunglasses, helmets, facial hair, oven mitts, and other random gear to change your class's look. There are also entirely different characters you can unlock that not only totally overhaul the character's appearance, but switches up their play-style as well. Sure, strapping a beard onto the Scientist is cool, but it's even more exciting when you can get a totally new character skin that swaps his weapon for a telekinetic dolphin. There are even passive upgrades that can be unlocked as well, making for a huge amount of content to discover and plenty of reasons to continue playing.

New cosmetic gear, potted plants, deployable zombies, and other items are found via booster packs, which are purchased using in-game currency (at launch there aren't any microtransactions). Yeah, rewards could technically just be doled out for successful play, but locking them behind booster packs makes them significantly more exciting. It's a psychological trick and it works--I'd be lying to myself if I didn't admit to playing a few extra matches just to get the slightly more expensive pack to see what was inside (in case you're wondering, it was a few plants, a pair of goggles for the soldier, and one of six pieces needed to unlock a new Sunflower skin).

There's nothing groundbreaking about Garden Warfare, but beneath the absurd premise there's a clever, polished shooter with heart--even if it's held back by balance issues and a lack of maps. Whether you have a dozen friends you want to play Gardens & Graveyards with or a small group to grind booster packs in Garden Ops, there's a lot to like in Popcap's first shooter. Wow, I really didn't expect to ever write ""Popcap's first shooter"" in a review.","Garden Warfare is a fun, polished shooter, and what it lacks in gameplay depth it more than makes up for with fun cosmetic gear",1395878400,5,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Well being new to gaming (only got my Wii about 6 months ago) and having about 10 games I wanted to try this one out. Sure I expected story plot and training to start out with... but I had to sit through what seemed like 10+ minutes of dialogue explaining the weird story of the game before I could even make Mario move AND each time you start the game you have to keep hitting the 'A' button to move through the dialogue over and over again (so far I have done tons of button mashing to try and find the skip intro stuff and nothing seems to work). I do find it not as intuitive as previous games I have played as you are holding the control stick sideways turning it into a regular game pad (that you can point at the screen when you need clues or explanations of villians and creatures on screen or secret doors or passages). I am not a good gamepad player, hence my not doing most video games until the Wii. Beyond the talking in the beginning there is plenty of long talking segments in the game too...but they are farther between game play. I am already up to chapter 2 and now have two 'Pixel' guides following me around. Just how many guides you get in the end I don't know. I keep playing the game hoping to really enjoy it and I finally sold it to my roommate (who ironically was going to sit down last night to play the game for the first time and when he realized he had all that starting dialogue to go through he said 'another time, I have better things to do with my time'. He then grabbed his disc for God Of War and went to play it on his PS 2). He is a major gamer...all three systems. I am the one with the Wii.

I am not sure why some hate this game but cross platforming seems to play in here. This game is a platformer more than a FPS basically, so puzzles will show up but they are quite simple.  The best part of the game is combat, which is the game itself.  The bows, genades, guns are all very cool and sniping a lizardman's head off is quite enjoyable.
With that said, the game is a good, fun game that is enjoyable to play. The graphics are pretty good and the gameplay is solid. This is not necessarily a great game that I call my friends about, though there are many moment within the game that could be worth doing so. You basically spend the game killing lizardmen and occasionally dinos.
It is not better than Halo for it does not do anything new to the FPS genre, nor is it anywhere near as immersive as Halo.  The only vehicle you use is a teradon, and that is still all based on stages.  You are not as free throughout the game and there is no squad based combat.
Maybe gamers are just a little too spoiled with the likes of GTAIII and can't enjoy anything less. I still enjoyed this game for it's shooting action and gameplay.

I know they were new because there were no openings on the seams (one of those ""sealed like Fort Knox"" kinda packages). Anyway I got mine in the mail and opened them up. First thing I noticed was the odd-style D-pad. They tried to combine a circular rocker switch with the ""Four Diamonds"" style typical of Playstation. I dunno about the rest of you, but I find that style of D-pad to be really uncomfortable, and prefer the classic ""Full Cross"" from the NES/SNES days.

The D-pad could've been so much easier to use, had the thing actually been one full piece, instead of having that wierd sunken-in ""X"" You can't really move your thumb in quick circular motions (critical for 2D fighting games) and since there's that empty groove in the middle, you can't do quick Left/Right motions either (well, without feeling like you're gunna break the D-pad).

The graphics are good, but not as good as Syberia, or some of the newer games out there. I really enjoyed the story, although I think they could have done more with it. It reminded me quite a bit of Black Dahlia and the Gabriel Knight series.
Sadly, there were quite a few problems with Post Mortem. The ""multiple choice"" dialogs were not programmed very well. In theory, they are supposed to permit you to control the outcome of the game based on the dialogs you choose. However, I found that if I didn't follow the canned sequence, the responses stopped making sense before too long. Also, the dialogs were often not synchronized with the events in the game. I experienced several cases where a character would describe something that had not happened yet. Other times, I would solve a puzzle and much later in the game a character would give me a hint for that same puzzle. This lack of synchronization became very confusing at several points in the game.
My other complaint was with the inventory system. It consists of a single scrolling line of items at the bottom of the screen. Unfortunately, you collect a lot of ""junk"" during the game, so finding what you need can take quite a while. Also, when you use an item, it usually stays in the inventory instead of getting deleted. As a result, the inventory just keeps growing and growing. There's no reason why an adventure game today should have a clumsy inventory system.

3.0,False,"05 25, 2015",A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B000HMAVS2,Mark Baker - Carstairs Considers,"It's funny how characters evolve.  When we first met Mario and Donkey Kong, they were enemies, and Mario was trying to rescue a girl from the giant ape.  (Shades of King Kong anyone?)  In modern Nintendo games, the two characters seem to be friends and good guys.  But if you want to relive their first adventure, you can pull out Donkey Kong for the Atari 2600.

Back in the 80's, any popular arcade game made its way to the only video game system anyone had.  Okay, there were others, but almost everyone had the Atari 2600.  The Atari didn't have very good graphics and the sound was only okay.  But I still spent hours playing this system.

Now, there are variations on the story behind the characters in Donkey Kong.  When the game first came out, the main character was simply called ""JumpingMan.""  And I've heard that he is supposed to be rescuing his daughter.  But according to the booklet with this cartridge, his name is Mario and he is after his new girlfriend.  (I guess that part hasn't changed.  Even today, Mario is trying to rescue a girl.)

While there were several different levels in the arcade version, only two of them made it to the Atari version.  The first level is the classic everyone associates with this game.  In it, Mario has to run up ramps and climb ladders, all the time dodging barrels that Donkey Kong is throwing down on him.  Okay, so Donkey Kong and the girl never move.  Just use your imagination and memories from the arcade.  Mario can jump over the barrels fairly easily, the biggest challenge is making sure a barrel doesn't decide to come down the ladder you are climbing, but that's just a matter of timing.

The second level involves loosing rivets in a metal structure.  There are eight of them, two on each level.  All you have to do is run over them.  The challenge is to dodge the fireballs.  There is one on each level, and they don't climb on the ladders.  You can jump them, although they require just a bit more timing than the barrels in level one.  The fireballs can't move over an open rivet, and you have to jump over them yourself.  As soon as you release that last rivet, the game freezes and then you are back to level one with slightly faster barrels.

Like in the arcade version, there is a hammer that Mario can use to protect himself from the barrels and fireballs.  There's only one on each level.  It can be fun in the first level since you might hit two or three barrels, but it's pointless in level two.  You can only get one fireball since they don't climb ladders and you can't with the hammer.

You start the game with three lives; you never have the option of earning extra lives.  But that's okay because you just repeat these two levels endlessly.  You are playing for points, and the biggest point gain is for beating the level.  You have a bonus clock counting down from 5000.

There are no game variations and no two player mode.  Even the difficulty switches in the back don't do anything.  There is one way to play and one way only.

I already hinted that the graphics aren't the best, but that's not surprising if you are at all familiar with the Atari 2600.  Basically, even thing was done with blocks, so anything round has squarish edges.  You can tell what is happening, but it's so crude compared to what we have today.

Likewise, the sound is pretty poor.  You get one sound when Mario is walking and another when he jumps.  A little fanfare sounds when you complete a level.  Pretty much, that's it.

Since I hadn't played for a while, I wasn't sure how I'd do when I stuck this game in for a refresher.  I found it very easy.  I easily made it through three sets of both levels on my first game, only dying thanks to stupid mistakes on my part.  While I wouldn't swear I found this game that easy as a kid, I don't remember playing it for more than 10 minutes at a time - just enough to scratch the Donkey Kong itch.

Ultimately, that just makes this particular game average.  I realize that, given the limitations of the Atari 2600 system, this is probably the best they could do.  And I do have fun when I play it.  But I usually gravitate to some of the other games I have over this one when I sit down to play, and I have for years.  This isn't a classic version of the classic arcade game.

These days, there are better versions of this classic arcade game out there.  I'd recommend tracking down one of those and giving the Atari 2600 version of Donkey Kong a pass unless you really want this version.

On the like side, graphics and story are intersting and inflict a sense of desperation that Halo 2 didn't posess much of. The difficulty of levels is amped up a lot and there are a lot more swarms of enemies both Flood and non Flood. Scarubs are introduced as attackable and more weapons and vehicles are introduced giving more variety to the game. Also airel combat was finally used to a much grander level, which I liked. The ending is a good ending, remind me of Halo 1's ending.

Dispite those likes there is much to not like about this one. Most weapons don't ever feel as if they pack lots of punch. In Halo I felt as if I could rely on whatever weapon I had and that it would do the job. Here I never really felt confident with any weapon, even the Assult Rifle which isn't that effective this time. Brutes appear to be able to kill with only a couple of rounds and 2 melee's, where as in Halo 2 it took tons of ammo to bring them down.

The fact we are up against Hunters again really annoyed me as Halo 2 seemed to mention that they were with the Elites now (who gives about the Grunts). Also were as the first two appeared to allow me to get behind the eyes of the Chief, this one feels as if I'm not part of the character at all.

3.0,False,"12 17, 2006",A3GNIO6FPPIP84,B000BPBAPI,Captain Maximus,"I had great expectations about this game, especially after reading the 5-star reviews here and the 9/10 mark from gaming sites. I bought the game and played it, only to be disappointed. Essentially, this game is MOO2 with good and bad modifications, but overall worse than MOO2 and with uneven performance in terms of features.

PROS

1) More flexibility in ship design and look. This is almost a minigame in itself and can be quite fun.
2) Starbases can now be designed almost like ships through upgrades and can be placed almost anywhere.
3) There are now resource locations to be mined.
4) Trade routes are now actual ships you can design, build, manage, and attack.
5) What a ship can do in a turn is based on its speed. Faster transports can shuttle more population per turn, especially between close locations.

CONS

Even more annoying economic system. To make things ""easier"", now you have central control of percentage spending, which might be great for running huge galaxies with hundreds of worlds, but is really annoying and inefficient for players like me who prefer a small, cosy, well-managed galaxy with only a dozen worlds to worry about. At the least, there should have been an option to turn off the centralized socialism and allow individual planets to be managed very differently. Right now, the system is unwieldly and gives a big advantage to the computer.

The interface is cluttered, opposite to what other reviewers said (then again almost anything is an improvement over MOO3). A lot of the space on the screen is wasted on flavor text and borders, as opposed to giving you the info you need fast and easily.

Tiling in the world screen is not that meaningful, except for occasional bonuses. It seems like a waste of space. All I need to know is how many slots I still have in that planet and what I can build there. At least MOO2 did that for you automatically and you did not have to spend time on it and it was drawn far more beautifully than just Dune-type slabs that look 10 years old.

Combat system is primitive compared to MOO2, and even to MOO1 (which is over 10 years old now). It is also idiotic. So, if I have 100 lasers on a ship, each having 2 beam attack, my minimal damage is still 1? You must be joking! Also, one of the great features of the MOO series was that you could fight cleverly with inferior ships and still win. Guess what, you cannot here, because combat is automated. You get to watch the video and cannot do anything. Good job, guys, you really nailed it. Grrr.

The tech tree is unnecessarily cross-linked. Why would an advance in a remote field have to be a pre-requisite for an advance that you want? What if my playing style essentially ignores certain applications? Why do I have to research all this worthless junk before I am allowed to research what I want? MOO1 did a fantastic job in decoupling the research directions. As a result, MOO1 has some amazing games where you would have to really change stategy to compensate for tech tree randomization, e.g. having your superdreadnoughts still crawl at warp 1 because nobody in the galaxy was offered advanced engines. That was a big addition to replayability because individual games could differ enormously. Here, you do not get that and tech advances would be the same all the time.

Furthermore, tech tree does not tell you simple things like:""What do I have to research to get medium hulls?"" If you have a system of research prerequisites, you also have to put in a system that allows the player to answer questions like that quickly and easily. Instead, there is a big tech tree screen that cannot be scrolled quickly and cannot be zoomed out, and where tech is shown as a single-word box with no description. You have to do a lot of clicking back and forth before you can eek out the info you need, if you are patient enough. Way to shoot yourselves in the foot, developers. How about a decoupled system like MOO1? In addition, your huge empire can research only one thing at a time. Why? Why? WHY? Different does not mean better.

What is the point of borders, if at any time anyone can cross them without going to war? MOO1 and MOO2 did a far better job in that.

Morale is poorly implemented and makes little sense. If you are fighting for your very survival, I find it hard to believe your population will be that concerned with entertainment networks. To my knowledge, there is no 4X game that has tried and succeeded in implementing morale properly. So, the better games are the ones that leave it out of the equation, e.g. MOO1.

Why are growth rates set at 0.2b/week regardless of population size and type of planet? How does this make any sense whatsoever? A lot of strategic element is lost as a result.

Why implement a system of logistics points? Why limit the size of a fleet by them? Do the developers seriously believe that N scattered ships are easier to supply than the same ships grouped in a single fleet? That system may be true for a Napoleonic foraging army but makes no sense for space-age races. It is an unnecessary senseless irritant.

Under the economic system, you actually pay for your production. Yes, that's right, the beautiful factories you constructed and pay to maintain also charge you ""conversion"" fees in credits for producing. Same is true for research. Somebody explain to me why. I thought that was the point of maintenance. Also, under imperial dictatorships, why would you pay for something you own already? Pay whom?

After awhile, all the Star Trek, Star Wars, Babylon 5, cowboy, etc. references grow annoying. Playing a sci-fi 4X game is about atmosphere to some extent at least. Don't break it with sophomoric humor and obvious reminders that the developers are all human and have seen the same movies as the player. After all, this is supposed to be a different universe that does not contain Capt Kirk and Picard.

The political system is silly and so is the constant moralizing about good and evil. Guess what, this is a 4X sci-fi game, not sunday school. Ethics is a silly addition to this game, especially since the ""good guys"" are far more dangerous and insidious that the ""bad guys"".

United Nations resolutions are a good joke for a short while, but get really annoying real fast. Somebody explain to me why ""evil"" empires would vote FOR limiting the capacity of their military installations. We have all these different space races and cultures; why would they even consider holding such meetings and discussing socialist crap, like giving money to ""war victims""? The developers basically want to poke fun at our own UN. Fine, but not in 4X sci-fi. Basically, keep your own politics out of designing a game that is meant to be fun for everyone.

The game mechanics makes small empires very inefficient while large empires take forever to manage. Contrary to what the developers say in their tutorial, it takes more than one afternoon to finish a smallest galaxy. This is a general problem with later games in the genre, because developers refuse to acknowledge that MOO1's mechanics was nearly perfect and that people these days cannot afford to spend 12 hours on a finishing a single game. So, they continue making mechanics unwieldly and turning everybody off. That is why MOO3 and GalCiv2:DL are worse than MOO2, which is worse than MOO1 in this respect. Giving players the option to control 100 worlds is not as rewarding or important or even practical as giving them the opportunity to control a dozen worlds really well. So, the real issue is one of design philosophy, rather than technology or particular mechanics. So long as developers do not understand that, they will produce flops like MOO3 and GalCiv2:DL.

CONCLUSIONS

Overall, this game has a great potential and could have been even better than MOO1 and MOO2, but the above shortcomings made it fail. I shelled out 40 dollars for it and wish I could get my money back. I give it 3 stars only because of the improvements mentioned above and because it might be fun for a very select group of gamers with a lot of time on their hands and a big sense of humor.

IMPORTANT UPDATE!!!!

I tried to return the game to the games shop where I bought it and they refused to take it back! They said that because of the online activation feature, they cannot resell it to other customers, while the publisher refuses to accept back an open box! So, I am stuck with it and cannot get my 40 bucks back or even get store credit for it!

Norman Reedus does a great job lending his voice for this game and Michael Rooker does the same with Merle Dixon. However this game has many flaws that can't be ignored. There is hardly any story to this game as your basically going around and killing walkers from point A to point B. There are some characters in the game that have some tie ins with the characters on the AMC's Walking Dead so I won't spoil that. The group survival idea was good but poorly executed since you would send a survivor out looking for food and they would come back nearly dead and only bring back 1 bottle of energy drink. Something the game does get right however is creating the ""Walking Dead world"". Guns and Ammo are limited and you don't want to use them since the noise will attract a horde of walkers. In the end I will give this game a 7/10. It's not as bad as people say it is and definitely not the worst game of the year. I would not buy it at $49.99 but I would buy it at $25.00.

I figured this was going to be a flashy reskin of Watch Dogs 1.  I mean, look at what UbiSoft has done to Assassins Creed!  But they actually IMPROVED upon the first entry.  (Stunned silence...)

If you haven't played Watch Dogs 1, that's fine.  You don't need to have.  Basically the hacker Marcus is accused of a crime he didn't commit.  Conspiracy begins.  Marcus then has to dodge the conspirators while using his amazing hacking skills to survive in the San Francisco bay area.  I won't go beyond that because it's really fun to watch the story develop.

What gives me the happy game fun smiles is the amazingly detailed open world surrounding the Bay Area.  San Francisco and the surrounding cities are brought to life.  And as someone who travels regularly to SF, there are a lot of familiar sights.  Granted it's not a 100% accurate city rendering, but it feels like you could really be walking or driving around SF.  It does have a bit of that Grand Theft Auto V feel, especially with the immense open world - but I like that you are playing a character who is not a murderous criminal - you basically have control and can make him a more positive protagonist... or just blow things to hell.

The developer promised more freedom to develop tactics than in the first game, where everything was on rails, and the appearance of every individual enemy soldier and ally ran off a script. In some of the missions in the first game, you literally could not budge off a single ""track"" that was often just a few yards wide.

The new game does have a few missions where you can slip around an enemy to flank, but it's really not that different. There are still doors that are just part of the wall, that you cannot open; low walls and barbed wire (and even bushes!) you cannot cross. In a few of the maps your choice is ""flank left, flank right, or straight on ahead""... the enemies still are scripted and the big ""events"" in the mission take place on the same old triggers (shoot bad guy X, walk over ground spot Y). In many cases, progressing in the mission involves a door suddenly opening that you couldn't open before, giving you access to a new track. These sorts of limitations kept ruining the immersion factor for me.

The improvements in enemy AI weren't that impressive. Now the enemies take cover; you just have to wait until their head pops up and then pop a round between their eyes. Your allies throw back enemy grenades, but the grenade indicator means that 90% of the time that grenades aren't a big threat anyway. Smoke grenades were pretty cool, but in most cases unnecessary. With a bolt-action rifle and an SMG I could handle most situations without too many problems (on the next-to-hardest level of difficulty). And of course, others have commented at length on the regenerating health feature. I agree that it did speed up the game, but at times you feel like Rambo (in one mission, I was shot about 100 times and still made it through okay).

Some of the scripting is just weird. If you're repeating a round, you'll know exactly where the bad guys will be. Every German tank (and there are many) in the game appears to be a Panzer II, as far as I could see; how hard would it have been to design a few later models?

Others have commented on how short the campaigns are. I finished the first two in about 2 hours each.

So in summary, COD2 is more of the same. If you enjoyed the first game, you'll enjoy this one. But there's nothing innovative here, regardless of the publisher's promises. What I'd like to see is a game where you are told to attack a village, and target a series of AT/AA/arty guns (this mission appears several times in COD2). Then you're dropped off with your squad in the outskirts, and you can go anywhere around the village, through any building, climb a wall, have a buddy lift you up to the roof, etc. Maybe COD3, but I doubt it.",Review of SP only,1135641600,2,,

Alan Wake has the fingerprints of a masterpiece on it, but the game itself falls short of such a title.  There are moments of incredible immersion, story-telling, and action; there are moments where the game is clunky, cliche, and downright silly.  Overall, it's a rewarding experience that could easily have been one of the best games ever.  Read on for a breakdown of some positive (+) and negative (-) points.

(+) ENVIRONMENT: the graphics and sound in the game are good.  I'd say they are great, but you can see some minor graphical funkiness and lip-sync problems; these aren't a big deal, but perfectionists might have a problem.  The game world looks great--downright spooky at night--and really surrounds you in the world.  The music and sound effects are great and play at the perfect moments to keep you in suspense.

(+/-) GAMEPLAY: this is a mixed bag.  The mechanics in combat are pretty good: use a light source to remove shadows from a bad guy and then blast him with a weapon.  It works, it creates tension when there are multiple enemies, and the variety of light sources and weapons seems just about right.  The movement is okay; sometimes the camera gets in the way when navigating areas and jumping.  There isn't a lot of variety, and that's where it gets weary at times.  The light-shoot tactic is the same throughout the game; sometimes it takes longer with different enemies, but the basics remain the same.  Driving isn't too bad, but it's definitely not a driving sim.  There are also some pointless sequences that require you to push a button repeatedly--like pushing a cart out of the way (why not just use the stick to move it rather than button mash?).  Overall, the gameplay is good but not exceptional and does little to separate itself from the pack.

(+/-) DESIGN: there are several elements to game design that need comment.  The levels are linear and there is little in the way of finding secrets or exploring; there are little areas where an obvious side path is present to follow but even those side paths are one-way.  There is only one way to finish a level or find a way through a region.
The story is exceptional but gets too choppy and unfocused.  The tantalizing mystery really keeps you playing and wanting to see what happens.  The cut scenes, voice acting, and so forth are really, really good.  I'm not a huge fan, normally, of story driven linear games, but the pacing and narrative here was excellent.  Then you come to the last chapter... while it was good and gripping, the ending made little sense to me.  Maybe it was intended as a cliffhanger, but the scene fell apart as the story wrapped up.  This is a great weakness; a good story needs to be more cohesive and wrap up loose ends.  I understand mystery and cliffhangers, and the need to keep it open for the future, but I also want the story to make sense and I want to feel fulfilled when I play through and finish.
The game is fairly short: there are 6 chapters and each chapter should take no more than 2 hours to finish.  The upside is the game seems paced well and this time seems about right for this style of game.  The downside is the game time really doesn't measure up to a full price tag.

OVERALL (3 stars): Alan Wake is worth a play.  It has a good story that ultimately falls flat at the end due to loose ends, plot holes, and unexplained events.  The action and narrative pace keep the game going solid throughout.  The environments are fantastic and the characters are interesting.  The length of the game warrants a lower price tag.  I'd recommend picking it up for a discounted price, but I don't see it as a game of the year or other legacy.",Fingerprints of a Masterpiece,1289692800,,,

The Bad:...when it works, excruciatingly difficult, a few minor camera problems, doesn't look too swift

I'm not really a comic book person, but when a good game comes along I won't pass it up. UD is probably the ONLY game ever made that let's you jump 300 feet in the air. Jump over sky scrapers, grab cars and use them as steel fists, battle giant mechs and grab on the copters and bring them to the ground. UD pulls this off superbly but not perfectly. The main problem with UD is the extreme difficulty. The difficulty is unbalanced so you'll get an easy mission then an impossible one. The enemies just won't let up at all. You'll have 10 mechs come after you shooting missiles and what not and after a few minutes you're dead. This will make some people just give up (such as myself).

The game has a pretty decent story, but it's nothing too special. You are Bruce Banner who tries to tame the Hulk inside of him by partnering up with a scientist and getting various parts to build the machine to do the latter. Some missions have you protecting things, some have you destroying things, and some have you fetching things. That is pretty much all the missions are about. The combat is really rewarding and awesome. You have to basic attack but combos with these will do massive damage along with grabs and slams. You can buy new upgrades after you unlock each chapter.

There are a good 50+ moves and they are all different. Some vary from being able to grab and throw things while running, to jumping on copters and bringing them to the ground. This would be even more fun if there was some sort of block or counter button. You have to take all the damage that sent at you unless you purchase moves that send missiles flying back and what not. You can run up buildings and fly over them to get health but you'll be doing this more than fighting and it's so annoying. While the initial introduction of flying all over the place and jumping as high as a plane, and being able to utterly destroy a whole city is fun it gets old kind of fast because that's all you do in this game.

You do have mini-games you can play but they are pretty lame and boring. You can use a pole to smack enemies as far as you can in one, races, float and land in the middle of a giant ring, rescue people etc. but they just aren't as fun as they sound. Hulk fan will be able to unlock artwork and what not through pick ups in the game but this still doesn't save you from fighting the difficulty. The graphics are nothing special.

The controller itself is well built.  it looks cool and the smartphone holder is secure. For mobile gaming, you can get a controller fairly close to console quality, at least one good enough for most mobile games.  But if you compare it to console controllers, it falls a bit short.. The triggers are digital, which only makes a difference in a some games. The Directional Pad isn't great either. It seems to be modeled after an Xbox 360 controller, and it is rather similar, except it's lighter, takes two triple A batteries, and has Bluetooth.

-In regards to setup, it can be a hassle. Bluetooth connection is easy, and it starts controlling the phone, but the controller only works with certain games. I downloaded the MadCatz app as the instructions said to, but the app didn't really seem to do anything besides display the controls. On PC, it recognizes just as quickly with Bluetooth, and it has an option to control the mouse cursor, which is convenient. However, again, only certain games support the controller by default.  To try to get more games to work with it, I downloaded the program from the MadCatz website, which was bad. It was a drag and drop setup for some bizarre reason instead of just being able to press the key you want to map a button to, and there didn't seem to be any way to set up the joysticks. Also, the program used up a massive amount of system resources for no apparent reason. You can download third party programs which can map the keys better to work for all PC games, even those without built-in support.

Overall, after you get it configured, it does what it's advertised to quite well. If you want a controller with a good phone stand, this gets the job done.  Just don't expect it to automatically work with all games, and don't count on their software being a lot of help.","Some plusses, but the software support is poor and it only works with certain games",1402185600,3,{'Color:': ' Gloss Black'},

For the price (I got it when it was 30 dollars, and it's even cheaper now), this is a pretty good deal if you are an LOTR and/or RTS fan.

As far as RTSes go, this is an average game.  It's not as polished as Blizzard's RTSes, for example, but the gameplay is reasonably interesting, being roughly based on a rock-paper-scissors model.  There is little micromanagement to speak of, with the game mostly being concerned with strategic management.  This is a double-edged sword, since micromanagement can be frustrating to more casual players, but makes the game less challenging for better players.  There are some pretty substantial issues with the UI and visual design of the game, as well.

Really, the main draw of this game is the fact that it takes place in the world of the Lord of the Rings, and that much of the game directly draws from the movies.  Images, brief movie clips, and voices are all from Peter Jackson's films.  The campaigns are roughly based on events not just from the films, but from battles only briefly mentioned in the books.  (For example, BoME2 is based on the War in the North, while the expansion is based on the Witch-King's rise in Angmar and his destruction of the human kingdoms in Eriador.)

It's pretty much like the first version where you take control of four heroes (x-men or brotherhood or both-and you can switch between them), solve mysteries like finding and talking to certain characters, and fighting your way to Apocalypse. And like the first version, each hero comes with their own unique mutant powers.

One thing that was improved over the first X-MEN LEGENDS is that techbits(money) are plentiful and health/energy packs are usually dropped by every other enemy you defeat. Another improvement is that players have a choice of difficulty setting, so yes, there's an EASY setting, so the game doesn't get too frustrating. Also, the heroes and the enemies are more evenly matched, whereas the fist version had the heroes starting out at level one--while enemies seemed to be at level ten-- making it difficult to pass the early stages of the game.

Another plus is that when you finally beat the game you can choose to continue a new game with all your gear, levels, and unlocked characters intact, which didn't happen in version one.

However, the bad thing about X-MEN LEGENDS 2 is that it crashes/freezes when you get to ACT FOUR. This happens if you start carrying and stashing too much gear and is hateful! There's nothing that can bring you down faster than having a fun game suddenly freeze on you. It happened to me during a fight and I had no idea what happened.

The buttons feel responsive with the exception of the ones on the shoulders. I feel as if the shoulder buttons don't depress enough to give me the satisfaction of pressing a button, but they do make a clicking sound so it's acceptable. The rubber grips work well I suppose, my hands don't sweat at all even if I play for hrs. I personally think that the ""turbo"" button is too close to the ""back"" button, I used to hit it accidentally while trying to press back(until I opened up the controller and removed the turbo button lol). The D-Pad still has its huge size but I don't mind at all as moves come out easier. If I had to describe how it feels, I'd say its like the D-Pad was placed on the shaft of joystick. I have 2 MAJOR gripes with these controllers. 1. The plastic MC uses on the D-Pad is too slippery(coming from a man whose hands don't sweat during play). I modified my D-Pad to my liking, some people prefer it the way it is. My 2nd gripe with the controller is that after awhile of heavy use, the D-Pad gets ""mushy"" and sometimes sticks in place. I opened up the controller and discovered that the mushiness was a result of the silicon membrane(the thing that makes buttons pop back up after you press em') underneath the D-Pad was actually breaking!!! I find that unacceptable since my wired 360 controller which I had for over 3 years still works fine. Maybe madcatz should sell silicon membranes for the people who spend $40 a pop just to get a new one(since the controller itself is fine, just the D-Pad membrane).

It requires a top end PC to run using the highest video settings.  I could only play it with minimal settings on my 2.6 GHz dual core, 2 GB, GeForce 7950 PC; and even then the video and gameplay was choppy in places.  The gameplay is very linear, with almost no freedom of movement.  If you go out of bounds, you die almost instantly.  The gameplay is a series of short missions separated by cut scenes.  Some of the missions are just walking from one place to another (boring).  Others are very difficult.  Often your weapons are magically changed for the next mission, so sometimes all you have is a pistol or a knife.  The story line is almost incomprehensible and cut scenes break the gameplay up, wrecking any possible continuity in the story.  Then the magic weapons changes trash any remaining continuity that there was left.  This game has the WORST helicopter flight dynamics EVER.  It's so bad it should have been left out altogether.  Fortunately the helicopter is a short mission.  Bottom line: Amusing enough to play once, but this is not a game that I will play again.

3.0,False,"09 9, 2008",AXKJI57FKQ6YN,B0013ZEMUK,Austin Shau,"Let it never be said that developer Vicarious Visions lacks innovation and ambition: These folks have often tried to push the limit of portable hardware, first with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 on the Gameboy Advance and then in trying to craft a 60-frames-per-second 3D graphics engine for Spider Man 2 DS on the handheld's launch day.

With the new guitar grip, Vicarious Visions has made the unthinkable happen. Guitar Hero: On Tour IS Guitar Hero on your DS. It's not some cut-down version where you play it with your thumbs, like on a mobile phone, or with the face buttons and d-pad. It's Guitar Hero, in the flesh, with one hand curled up as if its fingers were getting ready to dance across a fretboard, and your other hand ready to pick and strum at a moment's notice.

There are problems, sadly. The issues with this game are largely mechanical, as opposed to with the content. The guitar grip is prone to slipping out of the Gameboy Advance slot during intense play, forcing players to reboot the entire system. It's also quite unwieldy -- and even more prone to slipping out -- for those with large hands. It takes longer to get to a comfortable angle with this peripheral, since your hand is tied down by the unit's strap.

Furthermore, though the strumming ""feels"" somewhat like strumming thanks to the pick-shaped stylus, the touch screen lacks the tactile ""click"" feel that comes from either flipping the strum bar on the console versions or actually picking a real string. It's easy to pick at the wrong area when you're not looking, causing alt-strummers to gape in disbelief as they mysteriously miss a series of eighth-notes because their first touch didn't take.

These are two large problems that are severe enough to hamper the fluidity of the gameplay. It is in this sense that the game doesn't always ""work."" Neither of these problems are necessarily anyone's ""fault"", instead being due to the nature of the hardware, but surely improvements can be made for the next go round. (How about an anchoring mechanism to keep the grip in place, and less finnicky strumming code?)

The other gripe you might have is hand cramps. Holding your hand in this new awkward position will definitely introduce some pain, and while ""omg hand cramp"" is a flippant complaint often used by Nintendo DS detractors, it actually does hold true here.

If you can tolerate these issues, then Guitar Hero: On Tour can be just as fun as the console versions if you come in expecting lower-quality sound files and a reduced tracklist. Hammering a tricky solo flat-out works here, and is just as satisfying to your fingers as it is on the console guitars. Shouting at the mic (I prefer clearing my throat) is a serviceable way of activating star power for the score junkie in you, and even though you don't quite feel like you're playing a fake guitar, you still feel like you're pulling off some mean feats when you play on Expert.

All told, Guitar Hero: On Tour is a viable option if you really want Guitar Hero in the car. It plays and feels enough like its console cousin, and is a commendable effort by the developer. Its mechanical issues simply cannot be ignored, however, and you need to be ready to handle them if you're going to plug in.",It works... but not always.,1220918400,8,,
3.0,False,"03 4, 2014",A276DZWHM4FU7Y,B00IKQDULC,ObiWanShinobi,"As a long-standing (and very dedicated) fan of the Castlevania series - the reviews that preceded the release of this game did little to deter me from purchasing it. And if you're an avid fan as well, then I would say the same can probably be true for you.

However if you're considering whether to buy this new or are just not the type of person to pickup a Castlevania game simply b/c there's a new one - then the following is for you.

While the overall story arc is a continuation of the very awesome LOS, and the basic action oriented gameplay is the same...there are a couple of very real issues in this here sequel that keep it from being as good as the last one. And while I am usually hesitant to give any credence to the usually overly-thoughtout professional critiques of any game - this time they're generally right.

The gameplay keeps with the basic GOW style that the first LOS established, but takes the ""clone"" aspect to the place where it's a straight up copy. If you played the latest entry in the GOW then you've played this. You can upgrade the three preset weapons you have via a basic skill tree from XP gained in combat. The new moves you get would be cool - if you could use any of them. I had this complaint with the first one as well, as both the enemy AI and the sheer amount of them this time around makes skilled combat almost impossible. You're going to be mashing the crap out of the primary attack button a lot more than you'd like.

The ""open world"" also really isn't that open, but it's def a step up from the previous linear setup. It's NOT even close to Symphony of the Night. It's just a bunch of backtracking to get a life/magic bar gem or two, but at least there's a level of exploration.

I've also heard folks complain about the way the game missed out on the opportunity to use a more ""modern day"" setting. And while usually those kinds of complaints are ""nitpicking"" in my opinion, in this case it's true. The backdrops/stage settings for this really do lack that Castlevania flair and are about as generic as possible. The original LOS nailed that. And while graphically there are some cool moments, you can't help but get bored with the types of things you've seen in everything from Resident Evil to GOW. If deserted alley ways with garbage cans, and overly complicated lava bridges are your thing...well then prepare to have your cup run over.

And the ""stealth"" aspects are as bad as everybody says. In addition to making absolutely no sense (i.e. Dracula can take down a whole army of enemiessome of which are way bigger than he is but still needs to sneak around certain ones?) towards the end they get frustrating as all get out. It's also just another mechanic to get you to ""do something,"" but serves no purpose.

And outside of generic ""pretty much everything"" I think that's one of my biggest complaints about this game. Most of the time the mechanics are thrown in just to increase playtime. For instance, you'll sometimes have to switch between the current modern setting and ""the past"" via a series of portals that you stand on. Which would be fine if you didn't have to activate the portal and then walk over to somewhere else on screen, then walk through this weird dream phase and then walk out of it. It's well past the point in time in game development where should be able to just stand on the portal and be done with it. It's just padding.

And this ties into the fact that for the first time ever you're playing Dracula in a Castlevania gamewhich should be awesome. But outside of the first few minutes - just isn't. Does the Prince of Darkness really have to climb up old beams to get somewhere? Really? I mean that makes for a great Uncharted/Tomb Raider mechanicbut here it's just silly.

Now all that aside - the overall story is great (the execution leaves much to be desired) and it's not a ""bad"" action game pound for pound. But it's not special, and there's so much about the experience that's just too generic and/or contrived to make this worth it. I am really glad that there are Castlevania fans out there that are loving this game, but for me this is the literally definition of mediocre.

And if you're trying to figure out if this game is worth it - honestly I could have given this a miss and been better off. If you're not die-hard Castlevania fan then there's nothing LOS2 has that will make it worth your time/money. Unless you've got an unlimited supply of both.",Falls Short.,1393891200,5,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

2. Military: Soldiers, Super-Soldiers, Tanks, & Helicopters
3. Infected Zombie Creatures: Infected zombies (weaklings), Hunters (big zombies), Hydras (ground tentacles, somewhat rare), Supreme Commanders (only 2! in the whole game), and one big boss

There is not a lot of diversity in the enemies you face. You can't actually clear an area. Infected or Military keep respawning, it never ends. Even in the ""infected areas"", there are still military there attacking you. If you want to just kill some pedestrians, you can. However, the military will be all over you and send helicopters (""Air Strike Teams""), everytime you encounter them. Kind of annoying since they usually send 3 or 4 choppers and you can't evade with your disguise most of the time so you have to run away and pick them off.

Even though you can unlock more abilities. Your starting character won't be much better than your end-of-game character; only difference is you have more attacks and a little more health.

I liked the character and his movements and fighting abilities. But playing the game? It is the same thing over and over again. Fighting the military and their helicopters while simultaneously fighting the infected while trying to consume pedestrians all at the same time. Same type of never ending battle each time. No scenery change, little diversity in enemies.

The main missions were monotonous. Consume a target, destroy a target, or defend this object.

""I found several points of the game to be unnecessarily aggravating to the point where I would have turned Prototype off and walked away if I weren't reviewing it. ""

""The world itself here is far from the most engaging..""

""It's a design that creates a lot of tension, though I found the action too chaotic at times. Even the policing system is dialed to the max and too aggressive. You can't do something as simple as run through the city while leaping off of buildings without alerting the Strike Teams, at which point you're forced into some shape shifting or combat. This can make the basic act of exploration more work than it should be.""

""Even while confined to a relatively small game world -- Manhattan is not recreated to scale -- Prototype manages to have visuals that range from bland to downright ugly.""

""Tons of enemies are tossed into the mix, and so the visuals suffer and the gameplay occasionally becomes too chaotic and unfocused.""

Generic Overview
------------------------------------
Moving around, leaping, scaling buildings and gliding is cool. His different abilities that you can unlock are interesting. Use claws, blades, a whip like appendage, muscle arms, or a hammer like fists. He also has other abilities like ""defense shield"" and thermal vision. You can take control of tanks and helicopters by hijacking them. And pickup soldier's machine guns or rocket launchers. The Prototype/Alex Mercer, your character, can also disguise himself as pedestrians or soldiers. When you consume enemies you regain health and can take the form of whoever you disguised (soldiers or pedestrians). You can also do special attacks but only when you have full health (you have to be in the blue section), consume people to get your health to MAX.

As far as the game actually plays, it is setup in one area, which is New York City. It is a free-roamer Grand Theft Auto type of game. A bunch of skyscrapers, a bridge or two, and the central park area has trees. You can't enter buildings and explore them, you pretty much just go around from one mission checkpoint to another. The side-missions aren't really worth doing, since killing gets you better EP rewards than the missions. EP are Evolution Points, you spend these to get new abilities.

3.0,True,"01 11, 2015",A2EPAOKA4T09T6,B0007ULFL6,John,"I had fun with this game.  It started with a good premise:  you are Jaws and you terrorize the island.  And it delivered on the premise.  But the execution took away a lot of the fun.

The game is somewhat open world, with a story mission at a location on the map, and side missions sprinkled around.  The parts where you swim from mission to mission are some of the most fun, because you can just destroy boats and kill (and eat) people at your leisure.

The problems come with everything else.  The side missions are generally tedious, and the story missions can be extremely obnoxious (even with a walkthrough).  The controls are generally fine, but aren't explained well.  Some, like the evade move, I don't think ever got explained.  I found myself thinking I was doing moves wrong because they require finesse and proper timing.  This is at odds with the shark's movements, which are sluggish.  The camera makes things worse, as the ""swim fast"" button generally locks the camera above the water and only shows Jaws' silhouette.  Many of the story missions don't have clear goals, and the camera is generally terrible in small tunnels, which is where you'll spend the middle third of the game.  There were many points where I was expected to destroy something, and when I consulted a walkthrough after 20 minutes of trying, I found I had been attacking the wrong part.

This brings up my other big complaint about the game:  throwing barrels.  Nearly every story mission involves picking up an exploding barrel in Jaws' mouth, swimming (slowly) to a pipe or guard tower, and then throwing the barrel, hoping you hit it.  It's cool that this lets Jaws destroy normally impossible things like Coast Guard ships, but it's overused to the point where it seems like it gets more use than the bite!

I'm on the fence about recommending this game.  The first quarter and the last quarter are generally fun, but the middle is tedious and shows all the flaws of the game.  If you're interested and can get it cheaply, have a walkthrough handy.  It's an okay game to kill an afternoon with, just be aware Jaws should have been named ""Barrels"" instead.",A Shark Throws Barrels:  The Game,1420934400,2,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},

3.0,False,"07 31, 2008",A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B00113JSCG,Terry Mesnard,"Most people attribute the start of the Survival Horror genre to Resident Evil.  While you can trace the birth of Survival Horror back far, far before that game (to Sweet Home or, if you want to stretch it, to Haunted House in 1981), modern Survival Horror games were firmly established by the first Alone in the Dark.  Since that first game, though, the series has been an up and down roller coaster that never seemed to be able to outmatch some of the better known and more famous franchises like Resident Evil or Silent Hill.

So, when Eden Games started to work on reinventing the franchise, I was cautiously optimistic.  A lot of the ideas and concepts they spoke of seemed like great ideas, and they seemed to be trying to Do Something Different.  Unfortunately, the sum is not greater than its parts and Alone in the Dark, while reaching for the stars, can't stay afloat.

Things begin appropriately apocalyptic.  Edward Carnby awakens in some hotel with some bad men arguing about cryptic shenanigans.  Carnby, no longer useful, is led up to the roof to be executed but before that can happen, bad juju hits the fan as a ""scar"" tears through the building.  From here, this first episode really picks up as you're trying to escape the building alive.

Here is where the goodness lies.  Alone in the Dark has a great opening that's appropriately cinematic but in such a way that only games can do.  The building starts to fall apart, you have to run and jump your way to safety, climb along the outside of the building while debris tumbles and while watching cars below you explode.  You learn how Eden Games created some appropriately realistic fire for the game as you watch it spread and have to put it out or use it as a weapon.  You'll see things happen to the various rooms you're in that will make you want to believe you're watching a cinematic, not playing through a game.  It's very cool.

And then you try to move.

Movement is the worst part of the game.  It's all controlled with one stick which makes actually moving feel as if you're controlling a drunk, disobedient person.  Once you get a melee weapon in your hand, you'll see another problem: using the right analog stick to attack.  You'll have to swing it one direction, then another just to attack.  Unfortunately it's sluggish, as is the animation, resulting in you taking more damage than you should need to.  Fighting monsters becomes a chore, one you'll grow to hate because as the game progresses, you'll learn that basically all monsters can only die via fire.  So, grab that chair, light it on fire and swing away...hoping you hurt it more than it hurts you.  Similarily, gun fights are also not terrific as you have to pop into first person whenever you want to shoot someone.  No lock and pop here.

Likewise, if walking around makes you feel like a drunk, driving is a good approximation of drunk driving, I believe.  The controls are incredibly loose and in the first driving portion of the game, loose controls isn't a good idea.  What should be an exciting escape sequence that involves the ground behind you exploding, tears appearing across the streets, buildings collapsing, fire, death explosions, cats and dogs sleeping together turns into frustration as you'll probably find yourself repeating the episode.  Over. And Over.  From the beginning.  It loses its fun and becomes a chore.

Towards the end of the game, the game pulls a Zelda: Wind Waker moment and has you hunting down certain things and destroying them in an effort, one has to assume, to artificially lengthen the game.  If there's one thing that Alone in the Dark does exceptionally well, it's the pacing.  When you hit this moment it's like running smack dab into a brick wall.  It's sad.

There's a lot going for Alone in the Dark, don't get me wrong.  The inventory system is a cool innovation.  The whole episodic ""TV show/DVD"" feel is perfect, with DVD-style menus complemented by the ability to switch to any episode you like.  The graphics are pretty decent, as is the engine it's running on.  Some cool, small features, like the ability to blink your eyes is very effective during some sequences.  And the pacing--for the most part--is perfect; it can really get your adrenaline going...until you're forced to repeat the same thing over and over again.

I really wanted to like Alone in the Dark.  I didn't honestly think that Eden Games would elevate the game to the front of the pack, but there was enough little things and innovations that I thought maybe it'd be a good game.  When I played it, I was amazed.  Eden Games wanted no less than to shoot for the moon and make the most ambitious Survival Horror game yet.  Unfortunately, reality is sometimes like gravity and unfortunately Alone in the Dark isn't the masterpiece I, and Atari, I'm sure, was hoping for.  Definitely give it a rent, but I'd hold off on purchasing it.",Greatness yanked down by poor decisions,1217462400,23,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

Wolverine's Revenge has a lot going for it, including a taut storyline courtesy of long time Wolverine scribe Larry Hama, nice graphics and cut scenes, a nice array of bosses (including Magneto, Sabretooth, Juggernaut, Wendigo, and Lady Deathstrike) and acceptable voice acting from Mark Hamil as Wolvie (sorry folks, no Hugh Jackman here) and Patrick Stewart reprising his film role as Professor X.

The controls are clunky, the camera is frustrating, and Wolverine's jobs mainly consist of slicing up a few generic thugs, finding keys, opening doors, and fighting the bosses.

3.0,True,"01 12, 2008",A3LVYCJIESGEZB,B0009VXBAQ,Kevin B,"The Wii is a great idea that has been overblown to massive proportions and has a number of failings that make it less than perfect for a real gamer.  First, here are the strong points:
1. Obviously, it has a fancy controller that does lots of things other controllers can't.  It is comfortable and the nunchuck is a fine addition.
2. The menu interface is simple, clean, and expandable.
3. Comes with Wii Sports.
4. Your grandma will play this occasionally.

Here are some cons:
1. The controller is not accurate.  I don't know why more people don't comment on this, but you don't point at the thing you want on the screen, you point at a space above or below the thing you want, depending on the size of your TV and whether the light bar is above or below the TV.  So, it takes getting used to and is far from amazing.  If this was truly a ground-breaking console, why couldn't they figure out a way for the aim to be better?  The freaking gun on the NES was more accurate.
2. It includes Wii Sports, yes, but that's the only game that the vast majority of Wii owners will ever play.  Your grandma is not going to go out and buy Zelda or Mario Party.  I know several middle aged women who went out and got a Wii because of all the hype, played Wii Sports for a few hours, and haven't touched it in months.  There are lots of simple games on the system, but none of them are any GOOD.  Mindless ports, quickly constructed party games, and bland nonsense plague this system.  A real gamer might buy Zelda and perhaps 3 or 4 other games for the system, but that's being pretty forgiving.  I personally own Zelda and that's it because all the other games are so childish and rehashed.  Mario Galaxy was fun for about 20 minutes but has nowhere near the depth or intellectual value I enjoy on PC games or even PS2/3 games.
3. It is 2008.  How can a modern, popular console not support high definition gaming?  Whoever decided that was mentally retarded or something.  Even with the component cables(which are an extra, ridiculous fee) every single thing on this console looks like absolute crap on my 46"" 1080p LCD.  Sure, it's at least widescreen, but so are PS2 games.  Everything is blocky, ugly, and distracting.  My PC and PS3 have games that rival real life.  The Wii has games that rival a sack of cow crap.
4. It has no hard drive and the SSD card functionality is painfully limited.  No hard drive = No game demos worth downloading, no video downloading, no media storage of any kind, no media streaming of any kind, significantly limited space for game saves, and no custom content downloading, such as backgrounds or mods.
5. No DVD playback.  What, the extra 30 cents of manufacturing cost was too much?
6. No high definition disc playback or game capabilities.  Already this is a problem for the xbox360 and will surely be a problem for the Wii.  Well, maybe not actually since the thing can't even produce graphics that would require the space anyway.  The graphics on the Wii look like they could be stored on a 1.44mb floppy.

So, my conclusion is that the Wii would be a great console...4 years ago.  Or, it would be a great console now at half the current cost.  In no way, shape, or form is this thing worth 250 dollars.  I'll probably sell mine and buy it again when it's far cheaper, available in a bunch of lame colors, maybe has a hard drive, and has some worthwhile games available.

My main complaint with this  game has nothing to do with the game or developers except that they should  be more careful about who they allow to start fan sites. A certain very  popular site, perhaps the best site with the best forum gave me a very bad  experience. In one of my first posts a regular there refered to me as  stupid and silly and wondered in public if I was senile. All this because I  questioned the diplomatic system in AOK, which any competent reviewer will  recognize as being a joke.  When I complained to the moderators of this  site about this abusive behavior and a general abusive behavior towards  Americans, I was banned from the forum and my ISP contacted for the crime  of contacting these people through e mail.  And now on to more pertinent  information.
I found the game easy to learn and fun to play. The  graphics were good but not great. Pretty soon I found myself relying on one  strategy. Wall out the invaders. Get to castle age as quick as I can and  build lots of town centers to expand and defend. Once you beat the initial  big invasion, the idiotic AI tends to just send invaders in little trickles  that never stop, but aren't that hard to deal with.
It's fun to use  the various seige weapons, but I didn't really bother mastering the armor  and tremendous variety of knights and swordsmen. They all looked about the  same to me with the exception of the english longbowmen. You could play  this game for a very long time, but there are lots of very good games to  play.
This is deep strategy, but not as deep as Railroad  Tycoon 2 and  Rogue Spear. It's also all tiny people and buildings. There's no zooming in  and out or rotating. The fans are kind of ummmm...well, you read what I  said above.
I only played twice on the internet and the first guy  left as soon as I knocked down his whole wall with a massive seige attack.  The game then ended leaving me without the ability to even finish off what  he'd built. My second game I used the wrong culture and after a prolonged  build up I quicklly got slaughtered by the elite teutonic knights. My Woad  raiders didn't have the ability to build cannons I found out too late. So  there you have multiplay in a nutshell. If you are winning, people leave  and call you a hack. If you are losing, they love you and possibly think  you suck.

Then after you assassinate him, and move onto your second target the game becomes more and more monotonous. Every assassination is the same. Yes there is a slightly different story to them, but the game play is the same. You get on your horse and ride to the town. Then you go to the assassin's bureau, after that you have to scale tall buildings in order to see your investigation missions. And finally after you do them you get to kill the target. The horse riding is extremely boring, as you go through the same patch of land every time, with a slight variation at the end. Also why don't they just give you the investigation missions, why do they make you find them by climbing to 8 high buildings in the city. Also there are mini missions like saving the civilians from the guards. There are only two sets of dialogue, one for the man, and one for the woman. Why couldn't they record another line of dialogue. These missions aren't vital and unless you like to throw your PS3 controller at your TV, I suggest you let the guards have there way with them.

The combat system itself is your average hack and slash. Basically you defend and counterattack when they try and hit you. It gets really annoying, because as the game progresses you get caught more and more by the guards. It's downright boring to stab people. Another problem is that sometimes he doesn't stab them, he simply punches them and knocks them down letting them get back up and join the fight. Every assassination you achieve you unlock a new move to add to your list. The game makes you practice the move every time you unlock one. None of these moves are difficult, why must I have a tutorial on them.

The story in this game is average. It doesn't really grab you like it could have. There are some great voice actors like Nolan North and Kristen Bell in the game. Unfortunately their performances were in vain, because the story can be explained in one sentence. A rebel assassin is sent out to kill 9 targets, and with each one he begins to question his faith in the creed. There is another part of the story, but I'll leave that for you to find out.

This game made me wince every time he uttered a curse word. The missions have two difficulty levels the super super easy and the hard. Why not in between? Laziness would be my guess.

I'm not expecting it to be perfect 100% of the time, but it happens often enough that it warrants mention and scrutiny. Unlockables are fun and add some depth to gameplay, though it takes a decent amount of time to unlock things, but on the other hand, there are a ton on things to unlock. Destructible environments add realism and a ""cool"" factor, but more than that, it enables players to alter the battlefield by destroying cover and vantage points for enemy marksmen. I found out the hard way that melees from up front aren't a good idea, as all one has to do to counter and kill you is press B during the animation (which means s/he has several seconds to do so), rendering the knife wielder a victim of his own weapon. I suppose one gentleman found this out the hard as well, as I was recently offered the opportunity to experience the sadistic pleasure of turning a rival's knife on him/herself. I think that tapping B and perhaps using an analog stick to point the knife (to balance it, the developers could make the it easier to stab someone in stomach than in the neck, for example, with appropriate damage for balance) could be a way to make this mechanic a little more fair, though I'm not sure how viable it is from a development perspective. It could also be one of those things that only sounds good in theory. Also, I've had a few cases where the game froze after a round, so my screen just stayed black. In this instance it's best to go to the Home Screen and eject the disc.

The single-player campaign is somewhat enjoyable for a few (and I mean a few) hours of mindless action, but like most modern FPS games, it has a generic setting with a boring story and uninspiring characters. There are collectible weapons and dog tags hidden throughout the levels as well as a score system (100 points for killing an enemy with an extra 25 if you melee or get a headshot, for example). Each level has a bronze, silver, and gold medal to earn based off your score. However, I found it bizarre that there is no bonus for playing on higher difficulties. If you want to get a gold on each level, playing on the easiest difficulty is the way to go. Another problem is that the game will delete your campaign progress. It happened to me three times now, so if you plan on completing any of that kind of stuff, you'd better clear your schedule for a few days and cram as much of as it as you can in a short timeframe, because there's no guarantee that it won't wipe your saves in a few weeks.

Overall, this game has potential, as the gameplay is solid and fun, but instability and oftentimes poor hit detection mire what would otherwise be an extremely high-quality experience. EA has yet again released a game before it was ready, and they're paying the price for it, based on reviews on this site and others, though I can't say that's the cost from a financial standpoint. I realize the irony in what I'm about to say, as this game is also published by EA, but I would suggest Titanfall, as the beta was very fun and somewhat fresh. Oddly enough, the beta for Titanfall ran better than Battlefield currently does, at least in my experience.",As stable as your crazy ex-girlfriend,1393372800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Okay, getting into the review.  I haven't played it much.  The game looks pretty good on the Vita, but it has hitches.  There are some frame rate issues.

The game can be played with either touch controls or device.  I chose to play touch to start, but I didn't like it so I changed to device and found that much better.

I haven't played the console or pc version of this game because it's a point and click adventure book.  I find it to be much more appealing on a mobile device, like the Vita.

While I've only played about 10 hours, let me just debunk this right now:  Destiny's loot drops are NOTHING approaching Borderlands.

In those 10 hours, and we're talking from enemies, chests, etc that are NOT included in the storyline, I've gotten exactly 3 pieces of equipment.  That's it.

If you played the same 10 hours in Borderlands you very well could come across a Legendary weapon, but at worst you would get some Purple or Blue rarity weapons.

So if this is one of the reasons you bought into Destiny, you just need to check that right now.  Maybe this will be addressed in a future patch but it's very disappointing.

As to why I gave this 5 stars for fun...it is.

- The controls are tight and responsive
- The graphics, despite some people's gripes, are every bit the measure of other PS4 game I have played so far
- The music is very, very good.
- The AI (for the most part) is reactive and will hunt you down if you simply try to hide (Though you can simply evade in most cases by moving out of the area and down the staircase (the 2nd story mission is a good example of this when you're swarmed by melee Fallen, you can stand at the bottom of the staircase and just blast them).  But yeah, there are still the guys going behind cover, popping out and go back in.  Some things never change :)
- Below the surface there are definitely reasons to play all parts of the game as it will allow you access to the best armor and weapons in the game around level 20 or so.

One final reason I gave this 3 stars is...you can't skip the cutscenes.  Ever.  So if you want to take all 3 characters through the game, you'll be looking at all of them X3.  Seriously Bungie...almost every other game of this vein lets you skip.  I know you want people to take your world in, but some people do not want to see the same 5-10 minute cutscene a hundred times.  This is something else you need to patch!

I have beaten every zelda game to date (except oracle of ages). Each has its pros and cons, with an exception of OoT which is arguably the best game of all time. Skyward Sword however is one of my least favorites of the series. It is obvious Nintendo was trying to find a happy medium between the Dark serious world in Twilight Princess, and the bright, happy, and cartoon world of wind waker. The graphics are by far some of the best in the series. But the game play had me practically throwing the controller at the wall in frustration.

I had the remote plus add-ons when I first started the game, and was having trouble getting Link to aim properly using the sail. So I assumed maybe with a remote with ""plus"" built in it would work better. It did to some extent, but it is still far from perfect. I think it is amazing that sword strokes can be performed differently with your arm movements, this tends to work a majority of the time. However having each monster killed with a different sword stroke is more annoying than enjoyable. Instead of the fun of running around the temple massacring enemies as you search for treasure chests, you must spend a minute or more on each enemy to figure out where and how to strike. While I'll admit this is more ""realistic"" to random slashing, it doesn't make for a fun puzzle adventure game. For example, Skultalas, usually one of the easiest enemies in the series, take timing and luck to kill, and that's after you finally figure out how to spin them around.

If you are a fan of the series, the storyline is very well done. The use of a hub world also makes getting around a lot faster. Overall it is still a good game, but the controls really killed it for me. Trying to beat the first temple was unbearable. Not because it was hard to figure out (it was one of the easiest temples to solve out of any zelda game), but because you had to get passed a few skultalas which was time consuming and irritating.",Good PRequel to the series... but also the most frustrating,1325635200,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

While the Summer Olympics has been over for over a year, now it is time for the Winter Olympics to come alive in January or February in 2010. But with all that feeling, there are so many people tyring to figure out what would be the best game to summerize the Winter Olympis. Back in 2006, there were so many that felt like they were just missing a lot of edge, and a lot of gamers chose other titles. With all the hype around now, Mario & Sonic At The Olympic Winter Games has finally arrived for the Nintendo DS. But there are some tweaks here that are different around, but is it worth it, or is it just a figure 8 accident? Well, it really isn't bad.

Mario & Sonic At The Olympic Winter Games for the Nintendo DS brings in a lot of the excitement and the gameplay that has delivered well from the previous game, but there are a few new things here that make the gameplay a bit different. First if all, there is a new Adventure mode that you have to go through, where you have to accomplish certain golas and unlock all the events through the story. At times, it can take a lot out of you, but is the only way you could get to play alll the games, before you master the game. There are also new characters coming to the game including Metal Sonic, Donkey Kong, and Silver Sonic. The events range from ice hockey, the luge, to skeleton, downhill skiing and ski jumping, speed skating, to rarely recognized like the Biathalon (skiing and skeet shooting targets), as well as dream events like the original Mario & Sonic At The Olympic Games. The graphics look great, the control is mostly strong in some events, but at times during some of the events like Ice Hockey, it can be a bit frustrating, especially when you're using the stylus at times, and takes awhile to get used to, but the gameplay is really a lot of fun to maintain.

Overall, while Mario & Sonic At The Olympic Winter Games is a great title for the Nintendo DS, there could've been a little more. Nevertheless, it really is a great title to enjoy for anyone whom had loved the original version, and anyone who is eagerly awaiting what is next. I really like the game a whole lot, and I absolutely recommend this as a great addition to your Nintendo DS library. While you might await to see what does come next year and who will win the Olympic Gold Medals, but for right now, let Mario & Sonic At The Olympic Winter Games handle in the real fun.

==============================

Combat (4/5)

Has a very God of War like feel to it. In fact, much of the game does. If you feel that a God of War style presentation or combat system strays too far from Castlevania's roots then you may not like it, but if you enjoyed the combat in God of War you'll like it here as well.

You have 3 main melee weapons. The Shadow Whip is the weapon you'll use most often and it has the best range. The Void Sword has a shorter range but replenishes health when you strike enemies with it. The Chaos Claws deal the most damage but have short range, and are the only weapons that can deal damage to some shielded foes.

Each weapon has it's own skill tree. There are skill trees that you can progress in as you gain experience points. You can also ""master"" certain skills by using them more. Once mastered, they become more effective in combat. This encourages you to use combos and skills that you may not have otherwise used as often, so that you can master them as well.

You also have access to projectiles like daggers, which do different things depending on which melee weapon you have equipped, you can send a swarm of bats to distract enemies for the stealth sections, and several relics exist that can be used as limited items such as the classic hourglass that slows enemies' movement, a bird that can reveal secret locations, a health replenishing flask, and others.

The camera can be a bit of an annoyance at times as it tends to leave some enemies off-screen and you may not realize that they're about to attack, which leaves you vulnerable.

My only other complaint is that it's sometimes difficult to perform a lengthy combo as most enemies don't get ""stun locked"" by your attacks and can then break your combo by hitting you, even while you're hitting them.

===============================

Story (4/5)

The game is almost too story heavy at first, forcing you to sit through quite a few narrated scenes. They're important, however, as the Belmont lineage and their place in the story needs to be examined. An artful presentation at least makes these scenes interesting to look at while they fill you in on back story.

Ultimately the story is pretty interesting especially if you've followed along with Lords of Shadow and the Mirror of Fate.

===================================

Graphics (3/5)

Not a bad looking game, but not top of the line either. Some of the meshes have some pretty jagged edges, particularly when at a distance, even with settings maxed. Some of the shadows/light during cut scenes can appear unrealistic and distracting when the jagged edged shadows tend to spill over the curvature of the characters' faces, etc. This is not uncommon in gaming at the moment however.

This game is heavy on blood (as can be expected), but in some moments when blood is shooting up or exploding out, it doesn't look very fluid. Again, not an easy thing to model and animate, but still needs to be pointed out.

===========================

Other gameplay (3/5)

Much criticism has been leveled at the game's stealth sections, although I didn't find them to be overly unpleasant. Changing into rat form to explore air vents or tunnels is actually fairly fun. My biggest complaint about the stealth sections is that you're not allowed to engage in combat, which is where the game shines. It almost seems arbitrarily thrown in, as if the developers wanted another aspect to the gameplay besides combat and exploration.

Much worse than the stealth sections are the platforming sections. Swinging on chandeliers is a series staple, but in this game it feels clunky and bothersome. Climbing feels fairly natural though and can be compared to games like Uncharted or God of War.

The game does allow for that Metroidvania style exploration however. Although most of the environments are not truly open world, they are large enough to allow for exploration and finding secrets. Many of the secret areas cannot be accessed until you have the appropriate skill or item, much like other Castlevania games, Metroid games or Zelda games.

==================================

Art/Presentation (4/5)

I applaud the designers for thinking outside the box and bringing the series into the modern era, but that's my biggest complaint about the setting. Although much of the game is in modern times, you'll still find yourself in gothic environments with old dilapidated castles, cathedrals and buildings, which keeps it from being too futuristic. I think we can all agree that Dracula fighting enemies in Times Square would be a huge mistake, and the developers avoided that pitfall. Still, seeing an electronic billboard or steel doors that can only be opened by a retina scanner just don't feel like they belong.

Make no mistake though, there is plenty of dark imagery, horrific and grotesque monsters, and dim hallways with flickering candlelight.

=========================

Audio (5/5)

The soundtrack is fantastic. The sound effects feel right at home. If I had one complaint it's that some of the characters' voice actors aren't quite up to par, but most of the major characters do a good job, especially Patrick Stewart who voices Zobek.

============================

In conclusion, this is a very enjoyable game that brings the Lords of Shadow series to a close in style. The stealth and platforming sections keep it from being a true masterpiece, but they're not so frequent as to ruin the rest of the great things this game has to offer.

In terms of build quality, the Microsoft one used softer plastic and a rubberized material, whereas the Plantronics opts for hard plastic everywhere but the extendible boom.

This game is really fun and highly addictive.  The title tells you who you control, mini ninjas.  Don't get me wrong though, the characters are still really cool.  But they can also be rather cute at times.  Thats what really helped me fall in love with this game.  The art style, colors used, and the whole concept of character design gives you a game that is very refreshing.  What I mean is that so many games these days are dark and gritty with copius amounts of blood and gore, where as this game is usually bright and vibrant and has cut out blood and gore.  Even the levels that are supposed to be darker tend to be beautifal in there own way.  When you beat enemies in this game theres no blood, theres this poof of smoke and the enemy is transformed back into what they once were, cute little animals.  All enemies except bosses were once cute little animals that have been transformed into bad guys.  But it gets better, your main character has the ability to take control of these animals which is fun but also important if you want to get all the items in every level.  The items are highly visible to animals and can be really hard to find for the ninjas.  All items you collect are either used to make items or are consumed to restore health or energy or some other stat.  Experience is gained from defeating enemies and freeing captured animals.  Meaning that if you want you don't have to fight.  You can try to sneak through the levels and free the critters to get your XP.

I'm a huge Spider-Man fan and if you're like me, all of the game's hiccups really gravitate a game that many will call sorta mediocre. With cameos like Luke Cage and Wolverine and the inclusion of putting the web slinger back in black, all I can say is this is fan service of the highest order. Is it a great game? Not quite but this is the best Spider-Man game in ages, my personel favorite next to the old Play Station game.

 The developers put Spider-Man in the GTA sandbox gameplay again and here it's done much better than in the previous movie games. The side missions are still a bit repetitive but it's kinda cool saving citizens from harm and fighting several different styles of enemies when the city explodes with bedlam. Best of all, no red balloons!

 Swinging around the city is really fun this time and the game is much bigger than Ultimate Spider-Man which was relatively short. The aerial combat is awesome and easily the best part of the game. Here you also get a new spin on things, the combat allows you to mix up combos by switching back and forth with the symbiote and the classic red and blue. Each style of play is unique and feels completely it's own. One problem is the value system which rates your good and bad deeds, save someone, it goes up, throw a car it goes down. The whole thing seemed really innovative but they really could have explored it much more.

 Some problems are hard to overlook. Some missions have you repeating the same attack over a dozen times which gets really old after a while. The bosses are decent, you go toe to toe with wolverine, venom, and the vulture which is nice but they should have added some more. With all these symbiotes running around, where's carnage? The biggest problem I had with the game is almost a killer though, with all of the increasing chaos going on around the city, the framerate drops to a snails pace which is a real shame considering how pretty everything looks. Towards the end of the game I felt like I was watching a slide show and I'm not exaggerating at all, it nearly make the game almost unplayable.

 All of that being said, when the game was firing on all cylinders I couldn't help but enjoy myself. The gameplay might be a bit of a button masher but cool moments like teaming up with Moon Knight and fighting Wolverine absorbed by a symbiote are excellent.

4.0,False,"11 9, 2004",A1PID2MT8MMPAF,B0002GTFIK,A. Griffiths,"Starting up the game of Star Ocean, the first look of it did not get me very interested. Big-eyed cutesy characters wandering around a leisure complex with nothing really happening. But, many hours later, how far away that opening all seems. Now they are battling to save not only themselves and their loved ones, but the entire existence of their world! Yes, I know, that old cliche. But did it improve after that opening? Oh yes.

Star Ocean is a complex game to say the least. Lets start with the battle system. Traditional RPG players may not be that keen to hear that battles are in real-time, with a team of three fighters, only one of which at a time is player controlled. Sounds a bit tame? Far from it. The first introduction to fighting is done via a simulator that the main characters use in a holiday resort. You only get one practise go, and I got soundly thrashed. What the hell was going on? The battle was non stop action, everyone dashing around doing their own thing at once, damage counters pinging all over the screen...and then I was dead. Luckily things get a LOT easier once you are stranded outside on your own, with some very simple fights to ease you into the system. Initailly I though ""Where's the fun in sharing the battle with 2 computor controlled allies?"" But I was wrong, After playing for a while, I gradually started switching between all three, just to see what I could make them do, and to see if my judgement was better than whatever the AI was making them do. And it's there that the fun starts. The battle action is highly customizable. Every aspect of the AI is pre-set by you, and switching characters can be done in a second, any time you see a comrade in a jam, or if you know they have an awesome skill that would be handy to use just about...now. The battles do look insanely frantic on screen, but luckily for those who need time to think mid-fight, lots of important choices cause the action to freeze while you pick from the menu of character swapping, magic casting, even down to items currently equipped and AI settings. There are several skills per character, and you have the option of setting your favourite four at any one time to short cut buttons...so if you are well prepared, you can just run in and start dishing out your favourite moves, no stopping. As characters level up, you'll swap continually to see what their new tricks look like in practise.

So, battles - bewildering at first, but soon sorted. And they really look great. You can run all over the place at will (the battle arenas can be huge), cast spells that fill the screen with special effects, or make your characters leap all over the place as they deliver great long chains of hits. Wait till you learn ""Explosion"" or ""Stone Rain""...the on-screen chaos will make your eyes reel!

What else...The story? It's fine by me. Every cliche is here, though. The confused hero with a power he doesn't understand, the childhood female friend who is frail but weilds the strongest healing and magic skills, the warring oppressors who turn out to be allies when an even greater evil reveals itself...it's all familiar ground. But the playable charcters are well developed in this game, and you'll certainly have your favourites. The excellent voice acting makes them come alive, and there's lots of it, which pays off. There are sidequests as you'd expect, with some optional dungeons and ""errand running"" type tasks. There's also the standard ""entertainment"" venue where you can engage in racing (bunnies!), play a chess-style tournament and take part in a fighting arena. But the major addition to gameplay is item invention, which I found to be very confusing. Inventions cannot be made to order, as the process requires that you experiment with mixing several factors and seeing what the result is. This takes a lot of time and patience - or of course referring to a guide, and even then you still need a certain amount of luck. I dabbled a bit with it, but it will take dedicated completists to get the most out of this side project. Of course the rewards for your hard work are some of the most powerful items in the game, so it's only fair I suppose.

I heartily recommend this game to RPG fans. Even though the story is somewhat predictable it delivers a surprising twist on where the ultimate threat actually comes from. My lips are sealed...it's a great plot revelation that I'm not going to spoil here. The amount of playtime depends on you - enemies in dungeons are always visible on screen, and can be avoided at will or encountered many times over (most areas re-spawn monsters if you exit) if you want to gain levels. The game graphics look pretty good throughout, monsters are well designed, and there is a good in game map that gets filled in as you explore an area - with a bonus for visiting 100% of the area. Camera view can be rotated at will, so it's your fault if you run into a nasty surprise. And some of the battles are hard...this game is no pushover. Some of the dungeons have save points that are very far apart, and the dungeons can be massive. But don't worry, you'll want to finish it - all two discs worth.

4.0,False,"10 9, 2011",A1IQV6AI7L9NOK,B000FUG5TA,Feelah the tigress,"Yes, finally!  I've been wanting to play this game for ages!  It just looks so cute, and I love adventure games, so I've been looking forward to this one for awhile.  It took me so long to get my hands on it though simply because I haven't been able to afford it for awhile and I had a bunch of other games in my backlog that I needed to play.  Well, now that I've played it, let's just say that it's quite different from my original expectations...

Graphics (score 8/10): Graphics are very cutely drawn (they look like they came out of an illustrated storybook).  The in-game graphics are crisp, clear, and nicely colored.  Not much to say here.

Music (score 7/10): There's no voice acting, but the game does have your standard musical backgrounds.  Most of them are decent but not terribly memorable, but there are some exceptions here and there.  For example, the music that plays in the planetarium is quite kooky.  There are a few in-game sound effects here and there, but nothing special.

Characters (score 8/10): Well, there is an interesting cast of characters in this game.  I think all of them could be described as ""quirky"" to say the least.  First, you have your main character, Mackenzie, who frequently looks like she has haunted eyes.  She's probably the most normal character in the game.  Then there's her butler, Cromwell, who is oddly creepy and condescending - yet simultaneously supportive of Mackenzie.  The other two main characters are Penelope (Mackenzie's sweet-natured friend who has a strange obsession with bananas) and Chloe (Mackenzie's grumpy friend who's always trying to steal her detective cases from her).  The rest of the townspeople are pretty strange.  Many of the adults look like zombies and there are also people who are anthropomorphic animals (like Dover the yellow shark man who eats cake all the time).  The game never explains this madness.  Well, overall, I can't really say that the characters are bad (at least they have decently developed personalities) but mostly they are just weird.

Story (score 8/10): Just let me say that this game turned out nothing like I was expecting.  I'm already pretty experienced when it comes to adventure games on the DS, and I was expecting this game to be sort of like a child-friendly version of the many detective-themed point and click adventure games on DS that I've already played (Jake Hunter, Hotel Dusk, Phoenix Wright, etc.).  In other words, I was expecting a cutesy version of detective cases, such as Mackenzie finding her friend's lost cat or something like that after poking around town.  What I got was sort of like that, yet completely different.  Really, this game is more of a surreal experience than the realistic detective game I was expecting.  Let me give you an example.  There is a scene where Mackenzie has to enter the dream world by huffing some dream mushrooms wrapped in a paper bag made of herbs and heated to release fumes in order to catch a thief who's wearing a giant paper bag who has stolen her friend's dream; she does this by inflating an anthropomorphic duck woman who's the landlord of an apartment building by inflating her with an air pump and then literally popping her using a teddy bear with a sharp metal horn on its head so that she flies across the sky and lands on the thief.  Yes, really, those things happened.  And that's just a tiny portion of this game.  Well, you may be wondering, is the story actually any good?  Um, it depends on what you mean by ""good"".  It's certainly weird.  It was weird enough to be entertaining such that I kept wanting to play just to see what would happen next.  I can't say that the story is particularly deep or emotionally gripping (and there are some things that are left unexplained, like what happened to Mackenzie's parents), but it's certainly interesting to experience, to say the least...  So really, it's not the emotional grip of the story that keeps you involved (because their isn't much emotional grip); it's more that you keep playing to see what maddening middle finger to reality that the story will present you with next.  Is this good?  Well, that depends on whether that sounds appealing to you or not.  If you enjoy trippy games, then this might be the one for you.  Once I got used to it, I enjoyed myself quite a bit.  Just don't go into this expecting a logic-based detective game.

Gameplay (score 7/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  Touch Detective is your fairly standard point and click adventure game.  You spend your time moving around, talking to people, and tapping the screen to investigate objects.  Pretty basic.  One small complaint I have is that you tap the screen to move your character around, and she can sometimes get stuck on the environment to where you must tap a slightly different spot to get her to move.  Overall, though, it's not a terrible problem and most of the controls work just fine.  As for the difficulty level, sometimes it's difficult to figure out how to solve problems or what to do next because of what I mentioned in the story section: this game and reality do not often meet.  Sometimes the things you need to do are so illogical that it takes you awhile to realize that you even need to do it.  For example, you fix a butterfly net with a hole in it by shoving it into a spider web.  It took me ages to figure this out because it's so stupid - if you tried that in real life it wouldn't plug up the hole, it'd just get an icky spider web on your net.  I eventually just found it by accident.  As it is though, I only had to consult a guide once when I got stuck, so the game isn't freakishly hard or anything.  Basically, once you start to comprehend the strange logic of this game, it becomes easier to do what you need to do.

Overall (score 8/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  Well, even though this game was nothing like I was expecting, I still liked it.  It's a really good surrealist piece of artistic medium as well as a fun game to play.  If you have any interest in point and click adventure games, you might want to give Touch Detective a try.  I'm looking forward to getting my hands on the sequel!",Interesting Piece of Surrealist Art...,1318118400,,,

I've heard people complain that it doesn't offer a whole lot of change or innovation compared to games like Super Mario Bros 3 on NES or Super Mario World on SNES, but honestly, that's kind of the point.  This game, and indeed the series of games that it spawned (the New Super Mario Bros games) are very deliberately retro.  They very deliberately use the same gameplay as the classics.

That said, they still do offer some new power-ups that allow for new/different ways to do things.

This game is a budget game, made on a very tight budget.  That means no redrawn sprites, and less detailed rendering.  Despite that, this game is great.  It is about 20% graphics and sound, and 80 % gameplay.

Since I should make this review short, let me begin.  The gameplay here is awesome.  And that should not be surprising, since this game was created for the purpose of satisfying diehard fans.  Diehard fans will love this game.  Why?  Well, it is because of the small roster.  ""Small roster?"".  One may say.  Yes, a small roster makes the game easier to balance.  While CvS 2 and Marvel vs Capcom has almost 50+ characters a piece, at high level of play you will only see around 6 or 7 used.  So basically the other 40 something characters are useless, and aren't considered for serious competitive play.  So this game decided to keep the roster small, and have the characters play the EXACT way they played in the games they are based off of.  The groove system in CVS 2 was great, but some characters only played like lightweight versions of themselves on some grooves, and other characters became unstopable monsters on others.  Well, grooves and -ism have been taken out of this game.  So there are no unpleasent surprises.  Examples, A-Groove Bison and A-Groove Sakura.

Anyway, it would take me 20 pages to tell you about each character and their individual moves.  So I'll just make a suggestion.  If you are easily upset by less than stellar graphics or sound.  Don't play it.  If you want to mash buttons and get a sense of instant gratification.  Don't play it.  If you want a huge roster, with almost 4 over power players, loaded with glitches.  Don't play it.  But, if you look to win by skills, or like a diverse roster, or you like to learn new characters.  Then drop a few bucks out of your wallet and play the bloody thing.

SimCity 3000 Unlimited doesn't really offer features that attract most gamers, however.  While the ""unlimited"" aspect of creating your own scenarios seems nice, don't think that you can just run the application and simply make a scenario.  You gotta read the instruction manual for sure!  (All of it.)

Sure, more disasters can be nice, but I am the kind of player who turns them off.  That is, I like to actually build cities, not tear them down.  If I am unsatisfied, I delete them and start over.  But hey, if you like disasters, you got four (4) more with the Unlimited version.

Also, don't think the gameplay is changing one bit - it isn't.  But if you think that new Asian and European artwork is cool enough to justify a ""brand new"" game separate from the original, well, you will need more money, my friend.  I personally do not see a justification for adding some content and adding the word ""Unlimited"" to the title, then selling it for top dollar.  This might have been the rare time where I would actually approve of an expension pack version.  (Though I would have passed on it with today's knowledge.)

And if you were expecting new buildings, you get one: it's a Halloween haunted house.  Tell me, where are you going to put that monstrosity?  It looks more like an under-developed zone in your city, and the sound effects are worthless for city-building purposes.

The game has a unique feel to it, because its approach to economics, ship building, etc., are different from other turn-based strategy games that I've played (MOO, Civ2).  Some people have complained about this, especially the different approach to ship building (which uses pre-defined ship classes that can't be customized), but there's nothing wrong with it.  You just have to be prepared for a new way of doing things.
One problem with the game is that it is very poorly documented. You often have to build improvements and ships in order to determine what they really give you.  As an example, the first time I built a manufacturing center I was surprised to see my expenses go up by twice the monthly maintenance fee for the center.  It took a lot of hunting around on the web and playing with the game before I figured out what was going on.
(Increasing your manufacturing output always costs you money and never makes you any money in GalCiv.  This isn't entirely intuitive, but once you know this, you can factor it into your tactics.  Don't expect the manual to give you this type of information.  It doesn't even define the term ""manufacturing"" anywhere....)
Also, many aspects of the game work on a delayed reaction time. One example: I had a starbase providing a 65% bonus to the social and military production of planets in that sector. When I destroyed the starbase, it took about 3 game turns for the affected planets to show the change. This delayed reaction can be confusing and misleading, especially when you are trying to figure out what a particular improvement gets you.
This game has other issues, including crashes to desktop and uneven difficulty levels.
However, I am gradually getting to like the game better as I play it more.

I've had MarioKart since first buying my Wii a few years ago.  I've been stuck on the same six competitions for almost as long because I can't figure out how to unlock any more.  BORED TO TEARS (note:  I'm a 42-year-old woman working two jobs, I don't have huge blocks of time to devote to video games).

Last night I was playing and an hour flew by without me even noticing.  Great workout, and the main reason I bought the bike -- to play games while pedaling and not just count down the minutes before I could get off.

Sims beats Mario in the customization possibilities as well as the variety of tracks and challenges -- some races, some beat the clock, some collect the items.  They rotate randomly and often enough to keep me well interested.  The races seem easy to win, but it's deceptive; it's easy to win a bronze medal. Silver and gold, appropriately, require a bit more effort, so this isn't just for little kids (though little kids would certainly enjoy it too).

The in-game characters you meet are a bit tiresome, as they babble at you in a non-language with no way to turn them off.  I do love the emo kid in the forest who pities us racers: ""All that work just to end up back where you started.""  He's right, but I don't mind so much if I'm working up a good sweat doing it.

Re: Total War: Medieval Total War (MTW)
(I didn't play Viking Invasion yet)
Introduction: This in not a review of MTW but a plea to The Creative Assembly to develop the ""dream"" strategy war game. Because MTW is the closest I've ever played to the ""dream"" game it serves as the default. I'll highlight the positive aspects of MTW & suggest improvements. Sometimes I'll use examples from other war games.
1) Turn based with real time battles: This is the single most important aspect of a strategy war game because it allows for much more detail (as opposed to real time, like Age of Empires).
2) Three map ""depths"":
2.1) World: this we do have in MTW with some nice features like population loyalty influenced by the distance of the king from the province (you can make it even more difficult to hold non-homeland provinces far from the king), different agents etch.
2.2) Provincial: this map we do not have in MTW. The provincial management in MTW is not detailed enough. Lords of the Realm II (LotR) is preferred here:
2.2.a) Various resources that you need & can get hold of by exploitation or purchasing
2.2.b) Keeping the population happy by more than only low taxes (food, health, low conscription etch)
2.2.c) Armies on the provincial map destroying resources by marching over it
2.2.d) The calamities can be more severe: apart from what happen in MTW (floods, disease etch) the calamities must also infect the armies in the province where it occurs: army & population sizes may be reduced by disease & plagues. The bigger the army the higher the risk (see the game ""Risk""). Armies & population can be protected against disease & plagues by high food quantities, bigger castles etch
2.2e) ""Armies eat"" - armies feeding from the food in the province: make sure you can feed the army AND the population (or your army only during a siege)
2.2.e) Desertion or revolt by armies due to non-payment or low food quantities etch
2.2.f) Moving away or revolt by the population due to low food quantities, high taxes etch
2.2.g) Dispatching resources between provinces
2.2.h) Buildings & exploitation of resources go quicker or slower depending on how many workers you assign
2.3) Battlefields: this justifies a separate paragraph:
3) Battlefields
3.1) Battlefields: this is the absolute highlight of MTW: high artificial intelligence, ranks of generals, fatigue, morale, valor, elevation, hiding in bush, group formations, re-enforcements etch etch. One big improvement needs to be made: the enemy generals practically commit suicide by storming into battle. I simply keep my general a bit to the background, protect my missile units by sending my hand-to-hand combat units into combat & then aim all my missiles at the enemy general. Once the enemy general is eliminated it's 70% easier to win the battle. Simply make the general 5 times more difficult to kill or figure out something else.
3.2) Castle sieges: give the attacker also limited time: practical factors like availability of food, desertion, disease etch may force the attacker to assault or withdraw, depending how long the defender can hold out (limited by similar factors, especially food quantities).
3.3) Castle assaults: why can MTW's brilliant battlefields not be extended to castle assaults? LotR is again preferred here (apart from low artificial intelligence & MTW's self-shooting towers). Moats, battering rams, siege towers, hot liquids, missile units on walls with advantage etch.
3.4) Enemy fleets in MTW don't combine, making it easier to destroy them one at a time.
3.5) Realistic naval battles shall be nice.
4) General: Other realistic features that can be added:
a) NB: The never-ending rivalry between heirs for the throne: princes murdered each other or their own father, kings murdered possible competitors (even their own sons), queens & concubines murdered kings etch etch. How many kings died peacefully? A heir inheriting the throne without incident (assassination, ""accident"" or downright civil war) was the exception rather than the rule. Build this reality into the game. My suggestion: the king & high-ranking generals must always be exposed to assassination by other members of their own faction (apart from civil war, which forms part of the game already). The risk attached to to a high-ranking official with low loyalty must not only be civil war but also assassination or ""coup de tat"". Every time a king dies there should be a high risk of civil war due to rivalry between royals even if all royalty was loyal to the previous king. The loyalty of generals may even change from time to time so the king has to keep an eye on them.
b) Instead of eliminating a faction you can choose to make it's king a loyal (or maybe not so loyal) vassal of your faction, paying tribute annually - in exchange for higher loyalty by the population, for instance - (or was this only a feature of antiquity, in the times of the city-state?).
c) This type of game for any age or location is possible, I suppose. You can, for instance, replay the rise of civilization in Mesopotamia, the Antique Greek civilization & the rivalry between Sparta & Athens, the history of antique Israel & the conquests of king David, the history of Rome, the Middle Ages, the age of (recent) colonization, up to the modern age with a replay of the recent Iraq War etch. I'm sure you can even re-play the Anglo-Boer War!
The more realistically one can re-play history the nicer. I'm looking forward for a realistic strategy war game for the older, more serious, historian!?

I just want to add that the RPG format is a welcome change of pace to the Megaman X series. This game provides an opportunity to delve deeper into the real issues of the story. It's the best innovation for the storyline since they first included brief conversations before each boss fight in Megaman X4.

Although you can enjoy this game without having played previous Megaman X games, it does help. Definitely pick up X4 if you can.

The simularities between the K30 and a real Mechanical Keyboard are:

1. The mechanical 'click' sound. Not as loud (and slightly softer) as the real 'impression' of the key though it gets there around 75%.

2. Spacing of keys--they are raised up with space underneath. This is much different than a chiclet keyboard. There is about a .5 inch depression distance so that you will *not* accidentally hit keys while brushing your hand over the keyboard.

3. Weight of key depression. A bit more force is needed to press the keys than your typical keyboard. Very close to a mechanical keyboard in weight here.

4. Look. Put K30 next to a real mechanical keyboard, and it will be difficult to distinguish visually between them.

Not much left after the points above. There is much about the K30 that resembles a mechanical--which turns into a good imitation.

~*~ General Positives ~*~

The backlighting LED is softer than it is sharp. It is also subdued on brightness. There are 3 settings to use with only 1 color: Red (there is a multicolor keyboard that is 20$ more if you want more colors) and the brightest luminescence does not shine in the eye or become distracting if gaming in a dark room. The backlight is even across all keys with no 'concentrated' spots.

As mentioned above, the key feel is similar to a mechanical keyboard however I will restate again that the feel is fantastic. Although this is labeled as a 'gaming' keyboard, it can be--and should be--considered for normal uses because simply, the quality is higher than the majority of non-gaming keyboards. With the stiffer keys that are not 'flush' with the board, you gain more accuracy in typing along with a strengthening of fingers.

~*~Only Disappointing Experience ~*~

Although I consider the occurrence an anomaly, my keyboard is warped so that is does not lay flat on a flat surface. For a keyboard, this is not good. You can put a piece of paper underneath the end with too much space however this should not have to be done. This is why I have knocked off 1-star. In general, I would want to give a 2 or so however, the manufacturing process cannot, realistically, produce 100%  perfect batches over the long term.

I picked this up without the Zapper for four dollars at a local game shop, and I'm pleasantly surprised by its quality.

The object of the game in Link's Crossbow Training is to shoot a variety of targets, and occasionally enemies from The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (from which this title gets its locations, music, and graphics). Sometimes the game plays on rails, while at other times you move around with the nunchuk as if you were playing a normal Zelda game. I would add that the use of TP's graphics results in one of the finer looking rail shooters that I've played (and I rather like these sorts of games.).

There are 27 stages over the course of 9 levels, but an average Wiimote user should be able to blast through the entire game quickly. The real challenge and staying power of of Link's Crossbow Training comes from attempting to achieve its platinum medals, which you get for scoring in excess of 80,000 points on a given set of 3 stages. I've gotten three so far, and will probably have a few more if I opt to sit down with it a little more. But a couple of those Levels (the ones with bosses, in particular) look like they'd be very hard to get that kind of score on. So there's a real challenge in this game for points players.

It was a very good game for four dollars, but even with the 'quest for the platinum medals', Link's Crossbow Training comes across as a pretty minimalist shooter. There's a multiplayer, but from what I understand, you can't play two players simultaneously... mostly due to the piece of plastic Nintendo sold it with. And outside of hunting down those medals, Link doesn't have a whole lot to do.

MGS3 just had all the elements of a great tactical sneaking game with its addition of a camoflauge system, which made up for the lack of radar. MGS: Portable Ops takes place just after MGS3 (1970) so you've still got no radar (sound sensor instead), but you also don't have the camo aspect, which is mildly disappointing. The camera is more tricky to control here, so I've occasionally run right into enemies I didn't even know were there until it was too late. However, with practice, you'll get used to tapping the left trigger to auto-center the camera over your shoulder. That tends to work pretty well, and after a few hours with this game, the camera ceases to be a noticable issue. As a somewhat unfortunate result of the graphical standards set by MGS:PO's console brethren, you may not realize that the graphics on this UMD are phenomenal. The textures aren't as sharp, there are more 'jaggies,' and the environments are quite a great deal smaller. But, this is a PSP game we're talking about. The truth is, Portable Ops manages to look as good as many PS2 games of the same ilk, and I have yet to experience noticable frame rate issues. That, people, is an achievement.

The recruitment aspect of the game may seem tedious and somewhat contrived at first. However, it quickly becomes one of the most addicting aspects of the entire game. You can recruit soldiers in-game by dragging their unconscious behinds to your truck, sure. But every unique wireless access point you find will yield you a new soldier as well, whether it be your router, your neighbor's router, the wireless signal at Starbucks or Borders, etc. Just select 'AP Scan' and stroll around the mall, hit the downtown streets, hell, sit on a freaking bus and just watch your new soldiers roll in! Not only do you use new recruits in your single player sneaking missions, but they can be placed in various specific groups in your 'army,' which will in turn yield other benefits, such as weapon/item development, intelligence reports, etc. In short, MGS:PO adds a new strategic layer to the series, and feels like a natural progression in the context of the epic Metal Gear saga, which already spans about half a century.

Although the single player campaign is very well done, and very engaging, the real meat and treat of this game is its online multiplayer suite. THE MULTIPLAYER PORTION OF THIS GAME WAS MADE FOR THE PSP. That's all there is to it. Yeah, so maybe you've still got a frustrating camera, but wifi battles have never been this lag free, or this intense. The catch is, to unlock the match play, you have to beat the first couple of missions in single player. But you will really want to complete the game at least once before trying to seriously compete in the cutthroat online environment. You'll have unlocked more powerful characters, increased the life/stamina of the ones you used the most, and picked up the more powerful weapons/items, which are all essential to survive against the many headshot assassins you will encounter. But encounter them you must, if you are to glean the full potential from this monumental handheld achievement. It is undeniably the finest multiplayer experience to be had on the PSP, and arguably the finest all-around PSP game to date.

May your headshots be abundant, and your deaths less so.

Happy sneaking.",Essential Entry in the MGS Catalogue,1168560000,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The original also made its second debut on the Sony Playstation. I never had the chance to play the original but it sounds like a great game, naturally I was curious to try the xbox version. Invisible War pulls the player back into the futuristic techno world after a collapse caused by JC Denton in the original. From the get go, players customise their character gender and portraits and jump into post collapse USA.

Invisible War offers a load of great graphics and lighting. Other departments such as particle effects are also very well done. The inclusion of rag doll physics makes taking out a room full of enemies both fun and entertaining-who doesn't love rag doll physics?

The musical score is for the most part very laid back but still very good. Sound effects and dialogue are crisp and entertaining. The voice acting is remarkably well done. The characters all sound believable and basically like normal people, not over the top or bland like most other games.

The gameplay is the meat and potatos of the Deus Ex experience as it offers countless new ways to go about completing objectives. This is truly an open ended game as the player can choose who to help, who to ignore and in some cases who lives and dies among the main characters. The biomod feature keeps gameplay fresh and fun allowing players to use biomod canisters found or baught to gain certain skills and abilities, and onward to leveling them up. Bio modification adds a level of tactics to the game as the player must carefully decide what he or she wants. The character will utilize different skills to become a ""ninja"" or ""Rambo"" or even a ""hacker"". Setting up one particular skill restricts the player from being able to use specific other skills. However, if a change of pace is desired, you can always change your skill sets by aquiring new biomods.

Levels of Invisible War will span from country to country and city to city. Each new area offering new people to meet as well as new objectives. The levels are well designed and offer a myriad of ways to accomplish your goals no matter how your character is customized. Although the game is extemely open ended, there are four final end scenarios. Which ending you get can be decided by key moves during the very last level of the game-basically every decision you've done until the very last level means nothing as far as which ending you see.

Deus Ex: Invisible War offers hours and hours of open ended fun as well as customization choices both character and weapon wise.

4.0,False,"10 4, 2004",A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00009WAUH,Cloud,"Nintendo for some reason tends to be stubborn. While they offer great games, they also have this attitude that they should stand out above all others with innovations and this doesn't always succeed. Remember Virtual Boy? Did you actually buy one, and still have it? Thought so. While Sony and Sega(and literally everyone except handhelds) were doing CD based games, Nintendo still came up with Nintendo 64, which took cartridges. They'll drop the brand new Nintendo DS which has the touch screen ability where you move a pen-like thing around the screen. Different yes but can you imagine how many games will actually use this? And most importantly, instead of online play, they opt for connectivity with the GBA/SP and let's face it, only 2 games really utilize this: this game and Zelda Four Swords. But anyway, onto the game.

Who knew a Final Fantasy game would have very little plot? Basically, the world is covered in a mist called miasma which is lethal to people so they discovered a way to repel this with massive crystals inside towns. Trouble is, they have to be replenished so they send 2-3 caravans to recharge it with myrrh, a mysterious substance you get from trees. That's it. There's no character development, no real big plot twists. Even Zelda Four Swords had a bigger plot than this.

While the story leaves much to be desired, the graphics are astonishing. The character designs are cute, the world's are rich and detailed, spells are fantastic, and let's not forget those cute redesigned moogles(they look fluffier here).

I didn't get far but as far as I could tell, there was only one bit of voice acting: a narrator which tells you a story of the dungeon/level you visit. The music has a folk/Celtic feel to it which, while doesn't have anything has stunning as Liberi Fatali or Aeris's Theme, it does fit the world.

As you've most likely have heard, you can hook up 4 GBA's to play it to it's potential. This may seem cumbersome(either you end up buying all 4 which is stupid to be honest with you or finding 3 friends who happen to have GBA's), it honestly is some of the most fun you'll have playing a game.

As for the gameplay, it's so-so. In order to traverse the world, either a moogle or a friend in multiplayer carries a chalice which protects you from the miasma. Like the review, it's a ridiculous idea that hinders gameplay, especially in multiplayer. Actions are done by cycling through either Attack, Items or the spells you've collected. You'll have find yourself attacking when you should cure yourself cause you didn't cycle properly. You can create bigger, powerful spells if you and your friends time your spells in the same spot but since everyone pretty much goes on their own time, it'll probably miss. The other thing is the spells(or magicites as they're called) can't be taken with you when you leave a dungeon which means you have to find them again in the new dungeons. Ugh.

Despite the many problems it has, it's probably one of the most fun you'll have in multiplayer but I very much suggest it. I end up playing single player as I only have one friend who has a GBA and he's busy most of the time but if you have friends with a GBA each, then definately check this out but you'll notice some problems along the way.",It's hard to review this really,1096848000,,,

I really loved Bad Company 1. I was hoping for more of the same from Bad Company 2. I was interested in seeing what happened to the lead characters after they stole all the gold from the first mission and I had hoped to learn more about the fate of The Legionaire. I also looked forward to the comedy - the first game was a lot of fun. However I got none of that.

The game opens up with a flash back to 1943 where you play a WWII special ops scenario set in the Pacific. This was very good and got my hopes up. It sets a more serious tone that goes through most of the single player experience. The plotline follows Bad Company tracking down components for a Scalar Weapon. In the first mission we see a tidal wave created that sinks the escaping sub. Later in the game it becomes and EMP device. Why? I don't know. There is unintended comedy when you see a burning city, the scalar weapon goes into action and then the members of Bad Company remark at how much worse the city looks. The comedy is that the graphic is not changed very much at all. It really killed the story right there. At that point I just wanted to get it done.

There is a back story of Russian Invasion that reminded me of World in Conflict, another game. There is also the mercenaries but they don't appear related to the Legionaire because they lack the ""Acta non Verba"" emblem. I assume they are part of the new evil group the Legionaire is setting up but that is just speculation based upon no actual evidence I saw in the game.

One major departure from game play in the first game is the use of vehicles. Instead of the immense fun of riding around freely in vehicles like in BC1 we instead have a few rail shooters (stolen... er I mean in homage to Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter) and one (1) scenario where you ride in a tank and fight some paper thin opposition. There is also a UAV mission you fly that is clearly the poor-man's AC130 mission from Modern Warfare 2. Oh wait, lets not forget the extremely pointless ATV ""race"" that you can't lose with no opposition that they even remark is a rip off of the snowmobile race from MW2. That mission was very memorable in MW2 and had some real challenges.

Comparing BC2 single player to BC1 I'd say it is about half as fun. I was disappointed in it greatly. It had some fun moments but they are overshadowed by the greatness that was BC1. I did not like MW2's single player game either because it was too over the top but the points the BC2 team tried to do better than MW2 were actually even worse.

Thankfully Multiplayer is where this game really shines. MW2 is warfare on drugs. You have crazy speed and nonsense (Fast Sprinting Double-shotgun wielding maniacs anyone?) BC1 and BC2 present more sensible combat. In MW2 you can really alter game play by using perquisites and odd weapon combos. In BC2 the weapon combos are generally sensible and there are tradeoffs. You need to be skilled at assault weapon tactics more than you need ""the right assault weapon"".

The game very highly encourages team play. You get experience points for doing team friendly things. For example if you designate a target that your side eliminates you get points for that. If one of your teammates does it in your squad you get an additional bonus. Get your squad in an MICV and you can earn hundreds of points easily from bonuses. The game encourages finding the enemy and helping your teammates out. Fixing a tank, healing the injured or resupplying someone are all worth points. Suddenly the conversation changes as does the tenor. It becomes teamwork oriented.

One of my biggest gripes about MW2 and other xbox live games is the blatant and horrific racism and bigotry of today's youth. It is shocking, to be honest. You don't get that in BC2 - the game itself encourages a different attitude.

The size of the maps is another great comparision to make to the other games. In BC2 they are simply HUGE. You could fit all of the multiplayer maps of other games into one BC2 map. I don't think I am exagerating here. They really are that big. This makes the game much more interesting. Suddenly snipers can actually act like real world snipers. You can actually outflank the enemy and use real world military tactics. The battles don't feel like cage matches anymore. The downside is that the graphics are less than stellar compared to other recent releases. They aren't horrible but in comparison they seem less clear and less realistic.

Overall you will get your money's worth for this game. While the Single Player game was very disapointing the multi-player game is fantastic and provides a great community experience. I play with many friends at the same time. It takes some work to figure out how to get around the 4 players in a squad when you have that many friends but it's not impossible. With party chat you can all continue to aid each other. The only downside is when you have multiple squads and some end up on the other team. The good news is that squads retain integrity from one game to the next.",Single Player is disappointing but Multiplayer is amazing,1276214400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

To briefly explain, I bought my first PC so I wouldn't have to socialize with other people.

No doubt, this is a fine looking game. My system is a Win 98 home-built Athlon 1.2 ghz with a geForce 2 32 meg video card and 256 megs of system ram. It ran fine for the most part, but I did experience fairly frequent lock-ups, possibly because I hadn't yet updated my video card drivers. The first several levels almost put me to sleep, having seen environments just like them in No One Lives Forever. However, I hung with it and was rewarded quickly with some much more interesting level design. Gameplay was immersive, with enemy machine gun fire ripping up the floorboards in front of me on several occasions. Enemy AI was decent, but nothing really new or spectacular. I was disappointed with the relentless linearity of the game. Most doors are locked and can't be opened, so you are led along a path that the designers obviously want you to follow. I much prefer a more open-ended design. I love to explore, and this game didn't allow for much of that. Even the original Wolfenstein 3D allowed you to explore everywhere. But this is my own personal preference. Some may enjoy the linearity of RTCW. Also, I'm a little tired of enemy 'bosses', though this feature helps the game remain truer to the original. Also, this game seemed a bit on the short side. By the time I was battling the final boss, I figured I was about halfway through the game. I'm just estimating here based on my gut, but it seemed about half as long as Half Life or No One Lives Forever. The game is fun, no doubt, or I wouldn't have given it 4 stars.

I have been a Halo fan since Halo 2 it was my first Halo game, but how does it stack up against Halo 5? Does Halo 5 feel like a regular Halo game or does it not? Is that good or bad?

Let's start with the good things about Halo 5 within the story mode. Firstly, the game has truly outstanding visuals and movie like cut scenes. If you need to watch how 343 made the game, you should check out their video series called 'The Sprint' where 343 shows off how the game was made from story mode, online, and the cut scenes. Secondly, the game is locked in at stable 60 fps and 1080p resolution, but it will downgrade if needed. The game will downgrade in resolution ""when we want to get really crazy with vehicles, visual effects and combat we can trade some of the resolution in order to maintain the crucial 60fps"" as stated by Chris Haluke from 343. Third, before you start a level you can choose which character you would like to be within the Spartan team of Blue Team or Fireteam Osiris that you are playing in that level. Its a neat feature and it allows everyone to play different characters for every mission you play... it gives a bit of variety. Fourth, the revives! AI and or your co-op buddies can now revive you when you go down. Basically another alternative to complete the level and not restart the checkpoint because one person died. Something that should stay in future titles.

Now the bad things within the Halo 5 story mode. First off, the campaign sucked... I mean to the point where it was only a 4 hour storyline (on Heroic difficulty) with 15 Missions (3 missions with Master Chief team, and 12 missions with Locke team) and the worst part is that the game ends with a horrible cliffhanger that leads to Halo 6. Second, in Halo 5 it makes Master Chief look like a traitor because he started to look for Cortana because he had a vision of her calling him. 343 makes him look like he is AWOL but, hes not a traitor towards the Spartans or anyone. And then, 343 makes this new character named 'Locke' look like a hero because he is trying to ""save him/rescue him."" Third, the boss battles are kinda lame to be completely honest. You fight Cortana's guardian named 'Warden Eternal' around 6 times throughout the game, which makes it very repetitive. It was shown in trailers that Master Chief and Locke are enemies, but not one non-cinematic battle between them happened. Only one battle happened and it was a cinematic between Master Chief and Locke... and Locke lost the fight.

Finally, let's talk multiplayer. Mostly the only game modes I'm interested in are Breakout (one life CTF game mode kinda like SnD from Call of Duty), SWAT, and Warzone (a huge 12 vs 12 game mode w/ AI and boss battles) to be completely honest. 343 has stated that all DLC for the game will be free and Forge will come out in December (in 2015) so that is a plus for everyone. The game does have microtransactions the items are called 'Requisitions' in which you can use most of these items in the new game mode Warzone. But mostly the reason why people buy the packs it because they include character gear in which you can customize your Spartan with a new helmet, body armor, etc. The packs range from $24.99 to $1.99 per pack/bundle and they are NOT mandatory to play Warzone. You can earn 'Requisitions' in game within game modes you play and finish. Lastly, finding players for games is fast (better than the release of Halo: MCC) and it was needed for both the game and 343.

In conclusion, the horrible storyline within Halo 5 brought down the score and that is why I gave it a 8/10. Its a 4 hour storyline with a horrible cliffhanger that leads to Halo 6, very little and not good boss battles, limited story missions with Master Chief (that is one of the reasons why people buy Halo) and the game is mostly focused on the new character (Locke) and his team. Halo 5 does feel like a regular Halo but more fast pace and more competitive in that sense. Sorry 343, but you can do better or even a better job at starting a story for Halo 6. It doesn't feel like a $60 dollar game.",343 could have done a better job,1471219200,,,
4.0,True,"10 24, 2015",A3EY5MXRK0M5NJ,B00JKM06HG,Raziel,"I loved the game. The controls were great, the graphics gorgeous, and it was tons of fun. If you love action games and never tried a title in the Metal Gear Solid series you should still find it easy to jump into and enjoy this game. You also don't need to be an avid follower of the series story line to understand what's happening as this particular entry in the series serves as a prequel of sorts, but if you have played previous games there are still bits and pieces that will fit right in with what you already know and flesh out the timeline better.

The only drawbacks I can see to the game are that the story seems a bit short especially if you don't continue on with the extra missions after the conclusion of Act 1. Also gathering GMP (the game's currency) might be rough at first especially if you aren't into doing the SideOPS missions. I've also heard some avid fans of the series claim that this particular entry in the series is a bit more action-packed than previous titles, but you're still more than welcome to go the full stealth approach if you like without utilizing the other new systems.

Overall the game is still a very complete and enjoyable experience and I had a blast with the new buddy system and all the various trinkets and toys that you can develop at Mother Base.

They are a company that plays at greatness constantly, but can never quite find the correct balance of story and gameplay. At least, not since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars-Knights-of-the-Old-Republic/dp/B000067DPM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic</a>, a game which I still hold today as my most favorite game of all time (in addition to being my favorite story of all time). But ever since the days of Revan and the Ebon Hawk, Bioware has since attempted to bring that true RPG experience back to the players a few times over. And while they've yet to fully succeed in my eyes, this game certainly comes the closest.

DRAGON AGE: ORIGINS is a tale of dark fantasy that takes place in the nation known as Ferelden. It hearkens back to Bioware's earlier days in the gaming industry, when they were primarily known for their FORGOTTEN REALMS games, based on the popular Dungeons and Dragons setting. The land is being swarmed by an ancient menace called the darkspawn, creatures left over after a group of mages attempted to conquer Heaven and failed horribly. With the dark armies in motion, the player must join an equally-ancient group, the Grey Wardens, to quell the invasion before it destroys Ferelden.

I apologize ahead of time for my long-windedness here!

PROS:

--These days, if you play a Bioware game, then you play it for the STORY. Bioware have become the eminent storytellers of the video game industry with games like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars-Knights-of-the-Old-Republic/dp/B000067DPM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jade-Empire/dp/B0006ZJPSC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jade Empire</a>, and the most recent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mass-Effect/dp/B000OLXX86/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mass Effect</a>. The story for DRAGON AGE does not disappoint in the least, and I would say that it is one of the best ever put to disc.

--For the first time in a Bioware game, the Taris Problem has been solved. You know what I mean: the beginning part of a Bioware game that you will be doomed to repeat over and over should you have the wanting for a second playthrough. The part of the game where you're almost on autopilot the entire time, like Eden Prime from MASS EFFECT or Taris from KotOR (Endar Spire, Undercity, Swoop Race, Ebon Hawk, lightsaber--done!). The Problem is solved by giving the player several options for a unique beginning each time you play. There are three different races, each with one or more origin stories (six in all), with your choice of gender altering each of those in turn.

I chose to go with a male city elf to start out. Your origin story isn't something that's left behind when you get into the bulk of the game. It will constantly come into play, all the way up until the grand finale, which makes the game seem that much more dynamic. At the end of my first playthrough, I started up a female human noble, which was dramatically different from my last experience, and packed just as much punch. There is a great opportunity here for the player to walk away feeling like a unique story has been created just for them. I know that's how I felt.

--The CHARACTERS that will eventually become your traveling companions are marvelously characterized. Each is unique, likable, and confidently voiced. You'll find yourself investing a lot into them and how they interact with you. I loved them all, with Alistair, Morrigan, and Oghren standing out the most to me. I dare you not to laugh when you start discovering Oghren's inability to handle his drink.

--The GAMEPLAY is applied very well on the Xbox 360, considering this game was meant to be played with a keyboard. You're given a set of six hotkeys for your various talents and items, and a radial wheel that pauses the game so that you can choose talents that you weren't able to slot. It handles very well, though with a class like the rogue, it's a pain to pause the game to select another sword attack when the action is so furious.

--The gift system is a big plus for me. Giving a character a gift raises their opinion of you, which unlocks hidden talents. But, listening to your friends' stories actually pays off. One of the characters loved the smell of leather, so I have him some leather boots, which unlocked a cutscene and a conversation that led to more revelations about their past. A terrific concept that I hope is implemented in further games.

--As you might have experienced with other Bioware games, the worst thing about them is that they end. After investing so much time into your friends and the story, sometimes that drastic cut to black can be a downer. To ease the pain, there are several different endings to fall into, depending on your choices throughout the game, and a lovely epilogue at the end that gives a feeling of closure, rather than a cliffhanger.

--To touch on the graphics argument, I found them to be very adequate for a game like this. Not once in the game was I disgusted with the quality, with the exception of the dungeons, all of which looked as though they could have been made overnight.

CONS:

--This is a very hard game. I set the difficulty on Normal initially, and I died on every boss, in every city...all the time. This game shows you no mercy. If you want a pleasant experience, I highly recommend that you swallow your pride and set it to Casual. Even then, be prepared to die.

--I suppose I'm spoiled from playing OBLIVION and FALLOUT 3 so much, because I can't stand a disjointed RPG setting any longer. You will find no shortage of loading screens in this game, they are everywhere. Between cities, between streets, and sometimes between rooms, no matter how small the house is. I once entered a house the size of a shack, and there was a loading screen to get to the top floor. It was very hard for me to get used to it all, and I'd like Bioware to get to a point where their games feel more like an open world, instead of a collection of stages.

Although, I must give them props for implementing the campsite, which is easily one of my favorite parts of the game. At any point, when you're traveling between cities, you can choose to go to a campsite, where all of your companions will be lounging about. Many great discussions can pop up here, and it really makes it feel a lot more like true fantasy: traveling the world with good friends.

--I hate dungeons. I think there was a time, back in the day, when dungeon crawlers had their place in the world. And maybe they still do, but not to the extent that Bioware implements them here. This is a long game. Skipping most of the sidequests, my first playthrough clocked in at just over 33 hours. You will be spending most of that time underground, in dungeons so uninspired that I swore that some of them were exactly the same.

To me, they were boring. They took hours to complete, were filled with similar enemies, and often offered little reward beyond finally letting you progress the story. Again, I must give props to the story, because these parts of the game seemed like major speedbumps, but I pressed on just to see the outcome of what I was doing. (Special mention goes to the ""Broken Circle"" quest. One of the WORST gaming experiences I have ever had.) In further sequels, I would love if there were more things to do out in the open. Pleaaaase.

--The Bioware Formula is in effect here. Whether it's collecting starmaps in KotOR or coordinates in MASS EFFECT, you will be doing something similar here: collecting armies. If you've played other Bioware games, how the story progresses might not surprise you.

--As is common with games of this size, there are a number of glitches that put a damper on certain key moments. Dialogue went unvoiced a few times and some triggers wouldn't activate, which required a reload. There were no game-ruining glitches, but there were enough that it became noticeable.

CONCLUSION:

Don't get me wrong, there is much I hated about this game, but there is also so much I liked. The lore is as original as fantasy can get these days. The characters are amazing, and you will be sorry to see them go when the credits roll. The story, while predictable, is very entertaining. The combat is accessible, fully customizable, and fun. All of these save DRAGON AGE from being a mediocre RPG, to making it one of the must-play games of the year.

In the end, I desperately wanted to see my character's, as well as my companions', stories continue. The game's epilogue promises further, and more grand, adventures on the road, as all good fantasy stories do. I hope I don't have to wait too long to hit the road again with Oghren and the gang, but if we do, I hope that Bioware corrects the glaring faults that this game suffered from. Less monotonous, labyrinthian dungeons, more adventure, and more of that wonderful story.

First, I love Tailgate Party and one of the big reasons I chose to buy this was because the description indicated that Tailgate Party was included.  Unfortunately, the version that arrived does not include that slot game so, beware, if that's a deal breaker for you.

Second, while the description says it is only compatible with Windows up through Vista, the version of the game that arrived is marked on the box as being compatible with Windows 7 as well.  I have installed it on our Win 7 PC and it works fine (after I downloaded a patch... see below).

Now to my review of the product that arrived.  It loaded fine, but when I first tried to run it, it locked up a few times.  I checked the readme file on the disk and it said to check for updates on [...].  There was an update on that page so I downloaded it and the game runs fine now.

These truly are the same slot games you can find in casinos.  Rich colors and sounds.  If you like them in a casino, you'll like them here.  The risk of losing money is removed which can make it more fun than a casino.  However, the hope of winning money is also removed which may lessen the fun for some people.  Personally, I still find the bonus-type games (eg Texas Tea, Latino Machino) to be fun, but am pretty bored by the traditional machines (eg Triple Diamond) when there's no chance of winning real cash.

Overall, the game play - which integrates brainteasers with an engaging plot - is superb.  It's a slow-paced thinking game, great for those of is without the reflexes needed to play a lot of the arcade-style games out there.  It's also more fun than a lot of the 'train your brain' games, while making you think just as much.  I was very sorry to come to the end!

The downside, though, is a big, frustrating one.  They've tried to solve the worst of it by giving you a hint coin and puzzle finding gizmo towards the end, but it's rather hit-and-miss.  Just because it doesn't hit on a still-unfound puzzle in one scene doesn't mean it's not there - you might have to visit the scene half a dozen times or more before you get a hint!  And, of course, it seems to have a preference to finding the hint coins over the puzzles.  Still, I was able to preserve and find all but one of the puzzles.  The last, I have to admit, I looked to a walkthrough to find.  It would be wonderful if you could 'buy' a hint screen towards the end that at least showed you what scene you had hidden puzzles left in!

A lot of the puzzles are a bit repetitive (there are several 'pitcher' and 'chess' and 'sliding puzzle' ones) and some are a little tricky and a pit finicky, but with perseverance (and an occasional hint!) it's easy enough to work your way through the whole game.

I have to admit, if the plot were a book I might call it predictable, but as a backdrop to a game it was fun and worked well.  And guessing the ending is just another part of the fun!

I've bought this game three separate times now and have put in upwards of 500 hours across three platforms and I just can't get enough of it. The main storyline isn't the greatest in the world, but the near endless number of side quests and objectives more than make up for the story.

The remastered Special Edition features updated textures and a crisp 1080p resolution, but it also brings with it the ability to mod the game on a home console. Admittedly, Xbox One is the best platform to mod Skyrim because it allows players to install up to 5 gigabytes of mods that feature external assets, whereas the PlayStation 4 version only allows 1 gigabyte of mods with only internal assets. I deducted a star for the mod limitations, but this is still a great game.

I haven't installed more than a couple mods so far, but in my experience the mods work great and don't cause any hiccups in game.

Its disappoint short, with mediocre at best graphics (Sorry folks I've been seriously spoiled by games like Resident Evil and Silent Hill 3) and its story is just barely enough to keep you playing, much like the last one. The big difference is that this game contains many more characters (nine in all) and a much larger amount of missions. Not only that, but ROTK also makes up for its shortcomings with an incredibly well done two player Co-Op mode. This is a feature that every hack and slash game needs! Although the graphics are better than the lackluster Two Towers (which looked like a high resolution PS 1 game) its still not up to my expectations for a game baring the Lord of the Rings license. There is no lip movement (which is appalling with today's technology) the animation is stiff, and the game contains some issues with clipping and collision detection. Don't let these issues dissuade you from playing this game, however, without a doubt ROTK is the best game based on the Tolkein stories, period. No other Lord of the Rings game comes close (though War of the Ring is looking pretty good). This game is genuinely good despite its flaws. It is nowhere near as flawed as Vivindi's Fellowship of the Ring (which borders on completely unenjoyable) and last years Two Towers (which was fun, but defiantly not as good as it could have been).
 ROTK takes what Two Towers did do right and expands upon those ideas making a highly enjoyable experience that is actually worth the price of the game (even though it is still a bit short). I appreciated being able to play as every member of the Fellowship. It's what the Two Towers was sorely lacking, and I probably would have enjoyed the Two Towers much more if the character selection had been as versatile. After actually seeing the movie I would have liked to have more missions based off of Minias Tirith, but what's there was a lot of fun.
 The end of the game promises a new EA game called ""Lord of the Rings Trilogy"" in 2004. It'll be interesting to see how this game turns out. If the two EA LOTR games are merely ""demos"" of a much larger game I'm going to be very upset. If this is the LOTR RPG I've been hoping for that lets you play as all nine members of the Fellowship and follows the best elements of both the book and the movie with a deep, rich plot focused story that will take what was in the movie, and ad events, and characters that were in the book, but neglected for the film and incorporate them into the game.

Be warned when you start playing that you need to overcome a hurdle for the first hour or two. You could easily be turned off from playing by the atrocious cut scenes, wooden voice acting, and incredibly bizarre character animations. Cloaks float around as if they are snakes, even with the character standing still. NPC arm movements while they talk are laugh out loud funny. The women, of course, wear the skimpiest outfits one could imagine. And for much of the time the sky is so blindingly white that it glows.

But hang in there. Accept that the dialogue often feels like it was cut-and-paste either from Star Wars, from Lord of the Rings, or both at the same time. Pretend that the hand movements during the cut scenes are some sort of a comedy skit. Look at those as minor side traits of the core adventuring game.

Over time you come to immerse yourself in the main gameplay. You ignore the radiation-white sky and enjoy the detail in the various world you visit. Someone put effort into designing the locations in a way that feels organic. Ignore the Keanu Reeves Matrix no-emotion delivery of the lines and instead watch some of the action sequences involving sword swings. I've studied medieval swordfighting for several years and some of these sequences are quite sweet. Of course others are a bit silly, but you can't have everything.

The game has some features which other games could really learn from. You can set up three equipment sets and toggle between them with one button click. So you can set up your ""fighter outfit"" and your ""archer outfit"" and pop between them depending on the enemies before you.

If you're the patient type who likes to really immerse himself in a game world, there are intriguing books to read that provide background on the characters and storylines.

So if you're expecting perfection, this definitely isn't the game to play. Clearly the developers had a number of flaws that they should have fixed before they released this. A NPC will say ""take this bow"" while holding out an empty hand. Bodies will clip into walls. And yet the game has a lot to offer. I suggest plowing through those first few hours and getting into the meat of the game. Get into the spell system and the leveling system. That's when you'll see if the game's main mechanics will keep you hooked for the multi hours of gameplay that it offers.

(Okay, Resistance is close, but that's an excellent game as well).  Having a choice of primary and secondary weapons (and any game that lets you choose a fully automatic P90 as a ""secondary"" weapon is definitely giving you a great choice of arsenal!), as well as grenades and special weapons (sniper rifle or RPG as examples), as well as the ability to customize weapons (adding scopes, switching barrels, stocks, ammo clips, adding a grenade launcher as examples), you really do have an excellent range of weapon customizations.

One great aspect of the PS3 version is the use of the Sixaxis controller for the tandem paragliding segments.  There are parts of some missions where you're doing tandem paragliding, with one person controlling the parachute using the Sixaxis controller (and here's a problem, the manual never tells you that you're supposed to use the Sixaxis controller's tilt function to control movement, so we smacked the mountain a few times till we figured it out!) and the other person shooting, that's pretty unique to this game (and they recommend using a sniper rifle for that segment, but it's so much more fun using a SAW or AUG on full auto to mow down baddies while you're gliding...)

I'm giving this game 4 stars, because the single player buddie AI can use an improvement (patch?) but as a co-op on the splitscreen, this is a great game for me.

Several other reviewers say that enemy AI is stupid, that they just run up to you.  I don't know if they're playing it at easy difficulty, but enemies run up to me as well, but they run shooting and swinging!

There is one departure from realism that I'd like to point out, and I'm actually glad they did it this way:  You have a primary weapon, a secondary weapon, a grenade, and a special weapon, and you can pick up ammo, as a primary weapon and as a secondary weapon, as opposed to finding M16 ammo, or AK47 ammo, or P90 ammo, or a S&W ammo, or a M134 minigun ammo, etc.  This is a needed abstraction, since there are about a dozen each primary, secondary, and special weapons, and if you were to stick to realism, you'd never find the right ammo on the ground for your equipped weapons (needler ammo, anyone?)

Another thing that may be important to you is that the primary protagonists in the game, Rios and Salem, are mercenaries, and will act like mercenaries.  There's a bit of swearing, and there's some other guy out there who's more of a wild-dog than Rios and Salem, with a scene where he gouges someone's eyes and beats their head into the ground.  Yes, this game is rated M, just like Halo is, but there's definitely more violence and profanity in Ao2 than Halo, for example.

Featuring spectacular songs like the Rolling Stones' ""Paint It Black"" and Metallica's ""One""; Guitar Hero III also features selections from Santana, ZZ Top, Pearl Jam, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Smashing Pumpkins, Dead Kennedys, The Killers, Social Distortion, Iron Maiden, Slayer, Dragon Force, and the Sex Pistols among others; helping make this installment of the game be all the more memorable.  What hurts Guitar Hero III though is that the third time around, the game doesn't feel fresh anymore, and Activision and Harmonix haven't really done enough to make it all that different from Guitar Hero II.  There's higher difficulty this time around for experienced players, but getting there is a different story that casual gamers won't come close to getting towards.  Not to mention that the battle modes and boss battles aren't all that interesting or fun either.  It should also be noted that there is a heavy load of in-game advertising this time around too, nor is there any online play.  While online play would have been a great addition for the PS2 version of Guitar Hero III, it was pretty much expected not to be included here.  Negatives aside, Guitar Hero III is still a very fun installment of the popular rhythm series, and this version has the best track list yet.

You can save your game at anytime so if you just want to hop in for 20 minutes and then save, no problem. I think this game is pretty mindless to play and doesn't really require much strategy or thought to get through. Enemies pop up and you just blast away at them. If you get into a jam, just climb your way out (or run away) to heal and recharge, and then get back at it. There really isn't a consequence if you die, and you start right back close to where you died so there's not much back tracking. There are enough weapons to use and you can upgrade each one too.

Rabbids TV Party is good but not great. My wife and I play these games for

4.0,False,"12 17, 2004",A14T4WS6YCLETD,B0001NJHH8,Olivia Virna,"Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines was definitely a fun game. You got to shoot gangsters, sneak up on cops, suck blood from hookers, seduce night club people, punch guys peeing in public (yes, they have a guy in a dark corner urinating...), and make fun of homeless people. This game is definitely the sort of edgy vampire game America's been waiting for. From music to interaction to environments, Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines definitely outshines all competitors.

There's lots of variety. You can pick from seven different clans, each with different positives and negatives. It was loads of fun picking out which clan I wanted to be apart of. You can choose to be a: rebel Brujah, loner Gangrel, demented Malkavian, horrifying Nosferatu, aristic Toreador, untrustworthy Tremere, or royal Ventrue. You can be either male or female. If you can't pick out which clan you want to be apart of, the makers of Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines have even included a little quiz to help you out. I wasn't satisfied with my answer though, so I decided to choose my own character.

This game was very... sexual. Even as a female, you can pick up other females in the night clubs or even on the street. The game doesn't waste any time getting into sex either. In fact, the opening video features you and a vampire having sex. Fun, yes? Though I personally found their mix of sex and humor to be quite entertaining, some might be offended by it.

The structure of the game was rather weird. I didn't like the conrol set-up, really. I kept accidentally punching people because I would click out of frustration, and I'd loose all sorts of points because of that. Also, it took an hour to install. Yes, it took me an HOUR. Of course, it took me awhile in between switching disks, baking a cake, and forgetting to click ""Ok."" It was a very long download. It did give you a slideshow of concept art though, so that was nice.

Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines is a very picky game when it comes to picking which computer it wants to work on. For example, I finished installing it and picking my character (which took two hours... literally) the game froze five minutes into the game. I got VERY mad. I uninstalled and reinstalled (took thirty minutes this time), and five minutes into the game, it froze. It was because my out-of-date video card. It works fine on my brother's computer, but it does have moments where it... ""bleeps"" as I like to call it. Like when it getts caught on a loading screen or a reaction. It doesn't last long though.

What made the game really worth wild? It came with a soundtrack. Of course, I got it from Best Buy, and I'm not aware if all of the copies of the game come with a soundtrack, but it was definitely worth it. It features the artists: Ministry, Daniel Ash, Tiamat, Lacuna Coil, Chiasm, Die My Darling, Aerial2012, Genitortures, and Darling Violetta. The soundtrack was a very good addition.

Overall, Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines was a very fun and thrilling game. The only thing that made it four stars instead of five was how much trouble I went through to play it.","Sex, Drugs, and Killing Hookers",1103241600,,,

I decided to rent it from Gamefly, and I'm pretty glad I did. I think it took about 10 hours to beat the game on hired gun (normal) difficulty, which is a respectable length. I wasn't too fond of the storyline, but you can forget about it anyways and just have fun being a crazy chick with kickass slowmo moves and dual colt pythons. After you beat the campaign, it unlocks that challenge mode, where you can do speed tests or play the campaign trying for high points, and harder difficulties.
In my mind, this doesn't have a whole lot of replayablity, because you'll be playing the exact some thing, just on different difficulties, and that is partially why I knocked off a star. Also, there are a few spots where it's not so obvious where you're supposed to go (mainly the part where you jump across ledges).

INSTALLATION: 5
You simply place the cooler under the PS4's body and connect a short cable from one of PS4's USB ports to a Mini USB port on the cooler's body. It can be done in 20 seconds, easy.

DESIGN: 3.5
The PS4 is an incredibly beautiful console, an example of minimalist design perfection so, adding to it, you always run the risk of ruining that designer-intended balance that makes such a beautiful shape beautiful. This cooler, by and large, does not spoil PS4's native beauty. Yes, she will be thicker but the cooler, placed underneath, integrates well with the overall shape, color and texture. The only eyesore is the cable that connects on of PS4's USB ports to the cooler in order to supply power to it. I wish the cooler was independently powered and limited to being a cooler and nothing else at the expense of not getting that 'port expansion' about which I am not that enthusiastic anyway.

UTILITY: 4
The cooling fan turns itself on the moment it receives power from the PS4. It sucks air in from the bottom of the PS4 and dissipates it underneath. As I noted above, the idea of 'port expansion' is not something that I felt was needed for a number of reasons. If you are thinking about charging a bunch of controllers or headsets that way, think again. All you get is the power from one of PS4's USB ports and it's going to be split between the spinning fan and than powering 4 ports. You are not going to get much power per port so you will be waiting for a long, long, long time if you are going to try to charge several devices at the same time. There are many dedicated charging docks for controllers and I would use one of them and keep the PS4 for game playing. But the fan is good.

DURABILITY: TBD
I've only had this for a few days but I will make sure to update this review the moment the cooler stops working. Until then... it's good.

My overall rating, and I do NOT factor in 'price' because I don't know what a fair price would be for a console cooler, would be a 4 because I like it.

Your first few fights you have no control over your training which is fine because it teaches you what you need to know.  My only grief with the game is the advertising/video packages.

I have an old analog TV and prefer my Monster s-video cables to component because my TV is analog. Wii had 480p and component cables and played GameCube games so I thought this old GameCube component cable was pointless to keep any longer. I was wrong. What I didn't consider was this&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Game-Boy-Player-Accessory-for-Nintendo-GameCube/dp/B000090W86/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Game Boy Player Accessory for Nintendo GameCube</a>&nbsp;that lets you play old GameBoy games. Add a component cable to that and you can play Gameboy games in 480p. Retro gamers and collectors love that, hence the skyrocketing price.

Now onto my review of this cable. First off, I should note that I only used this component cable on a non-HD TV. And on my old TV the picture was sharp as hell but there was an obnoxious white film across the whole picture. I never did really figured out what that was and just ignored it as best I could for many years. Then one day I saw a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monster-Cable-GCGL300-SV-10-GameCube-S-Video-A-V-Cable-10-Feet/dp/B000092WZ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monster Cable GCGL300 SV-10 GameCube S-Video A/V Cable (10 Feet)</a>&nbsp;on sale for 10 bucks and picked it up (good thing too because they are going for like 100 bucks now). The Monster s-video cable picture was about 90% as good and didn't have that nasty white-out effect. So I kept my Monster cables and sold my component cables. Oops. Anyway, long story short, Monster s-video cables are better than GameCube component on a non-HD TV in my opinion, and will save you 100 bucks.

More about these component cables. I originally bought these online from Nintendo to try and clear up my crappy picture from GameCube AV cables. They came in a generic ziplock bag with no labels. They were not gold plated and looked ordinary and flimsy. The reason nobody else makes better or cheaper ones is because there's a chip in the base of the cable that makes 480p possible somehow. The chip can't be replicated for some reason. I should also mention that you need a compatible GameCube to even use these cables. Early model GameCubes can use it, later ones can't.

Anyway, that's my story with these cables. I hope it helped you. I hate to even look at these cables as they only remind me how I threw away 200 bucks. Bottom line, there's no reason to spend this much money unless you are a serious Gameboy collector.

Positives:
1. Even though player is limited to Europe, the map non the less is huge and extremely detailed. Major rivers are present now. Campaign map runs pretty smooth, which I guess can be explained that PC doesn't have to load India and Americas.

2. Finally advanced diplomacy options from Medieval II are back and some more. Example: trade embargoes, break alliance and other.

3. Interface: Overall it is extremely well organized and much better stylized for the period. General's, Government and Agent's portraits are looking great. Now they are done as oil paintings vs CGI plastic model look a-la Doom 3. Too bad that unit cards look like toy soldiers. One step forward, one step back.

4. I've played just couple of campaign battles and AI behaves much better than in vanilla un-modded Empire. Infantry attempted to outflank me. Properly formed a line, fired several volleys and weaker ranged units charged my line. Not bad at all, almost like DarthMod Battle AI from Empire. Immersion effect during battle is simply amazing. When units walk, dust trails behind them, musket fire will make things difficult to see (no need for Blood and Smoke mod from Empire). Low volumetric clouds/fog are flying over the fields. Canon balls leave ground grazed where they land. Finally, general's ability to rally troops from Medieval II is back. Units form and move much quicker. Path finding is much much better.

5. Battle minimap finally has proper topographical information - you can clearly see heights and valleys. Also, you will see variation of the battle map at pre-deployment stage when game loads battle.

6. Game performs quite well. I have all settings on Ultra, 2xAA and 4xAF and game runs very smooth on my hardware (see PC specs below).

7. When you take enemy's settlement you're presented with the choice to either peacefully occupy or sack. This is old Total War concept that somehow got lost in Empire.

8. A bit more units variety within same company - no more clone armies.

Negatives:
1. Since game is focused on Napoleonic wars, campaign map represent fewer geographical locales. Only Europe, so no North Africa (sorry Morocco), no Anatolian Peninsula, no Mid-East, Afghanistan/Pakistan, India, and of course no Americas.

2. I'm sad that this silky smoothness will not integrate or in any shape or form update Empire. I want to replay Empire with huge campaign map and cross continental invasions while experiencing not Beta 1.6, but final polished product. I have a feeling that Empire came out good 6 to 12 months too early. NTW should have been $20 expansion.

3. So far no unit editor, mod tools, or game documentation for modders. Don't have much hope that this will happen.

4. Steam is required for retail boxed game to install and play even in single play mode. More and more games are following this suite. It sucks, period. My problem with Steam is not that it's a DRM, but that I had to pay the same amount for rental game as what I'd have paid for the game I owned and could have sold. Steam games should come at discount.

5. Firing arcs of artillery and damage/accuracy of musket fire is arcadish. Basically line infantry have the same hit rate and cause the same damage at 100m and 25m. No doubt this will be modded soon.

6. Broken siege battles were not fixed, but simply mostly removed.

7. Research tree looks confusing. Also I wander how much sense there is in research tree when each turn in game is two weeks?

8. Very few playable factions. Episodic campaign is lacking as with prior CA titles.

Stay tuned for more updates.

We had two Wii remotes and wanted a third one, so we could do party multiplayer. We assumed that the games that came with this would let you have more than 2 people playing. Wrong! These are all only two player games. That really seems a shame for a system that is set up to be a party machine.

The games are all rather straightforward and use the basic Wii remote functions. You can do a target shooting where you shoot at targets, ducks, cans, skeet targets and even space aliens. There's a pattern matching game where you try to figure out which Miis are the same or different. In another game, you rotate and change poses of your Miis to match the shape shown. There's a simple ping-pong, a simple table hockey, a simple pool, a cow race, a fishing game, and then tanks.

I had high hopes for many of these games. I love pool, I enjoy target shooting, and even fishing can be great fun. For whatever reason, they just didn't implement any of the games very well. Fishing in Zelda is FAR more fun than this fishing version. Pool is done much better in many other games. Even the target practice isn't varied enough to be interesting.

The only game that really holds our interest for long periods is the tank game. I *love* the tank game. It can be quite challenging, and is fun to play both alone and with others.

Really, you're not paying much at all for this game set. You're getting a nice remote, and you get the games for free. If you've got very young kids, they might be quite happy with racing cows, knocking over scarecrows, and trying to get the very best cow-racing score they can. In that case, you're all set! You paid very little for a game that fits your needs. For most gamers, though, don't get your hopes up too high.

4.0,True,"06 1, 2012",A36NSXEFUPBTI3,B002I0J6DC,Peachy Fox,"When this game came out, it got ripped apart by critics. There were people saying how it wasn't Castlevania enough or that it didn't follow the main story canon in the Castlevania Universe. Point taken. But I also remember reading one review of someone comparing the gameplay, story, and art to Dante's Inferno but how Dante's Inferno did it better. After finally getting a chance to play Dante's Inferno, that it a huge slap in the face to this game. Even though Castlevania: LOS gets the hack and slash/QTE portion of the game right to a phenomenal level, it also gets punished by negative nay-sayers for being too much like other successful games of the action genre. Is it fair? God, no. That's why I think its one of the most underrated and ignored games of 2010.

**Story: I wouldn't call myself a total newbie to the Castlevania Universe, but I never followed the history after the first NES game. All I knew was the Belmont clan fight ghouls and must take down Dracula in every game. So I had the basics down. In this you get a new Belmont, Gabriel, who goes on a mission to help bring peace to the world by stopping the evil lords that that rule the land. There's also another main story of Gabriel doing all of this on the notion he'll be able to bring his dead wife back to life once he completes his overall mission. Honestly, the story is pretty basic all the way through. However, the art design, beautiful cutscenes and longevity of the game make it feel like one massive story. By the end, I was wondering if Gabriel was as exhausted as I was on the overall journey. Also, I must mention the ending. Regular ending and post-cutscene ending I'd easily put in my Top 20 best video game endings of all time. Hell, maybe even Top 10. Pretty powerful stuff.

**Gameplay: No matter how hard you try, you can't please people. Yes, this has gameplay similar to God of War, Darksiders, and DMC. So why is that a bad thing? LOS gets heavily criticized for borrowing mechanics from those games. Funny how all of those game were apparently ""original""  enough to provide future sequels or spinoffs which never stray from its formula, but LOS brutalized for following a familiar pattern that worked for past titles. The gameplay in LOS is pretty deep. It's not complex, as much as it is overwhelming at times. There are quite a lot of combos to learn, which can take at least two playthroughs to accomplish in unlocking them all. It's about knowing when and how to attack certain monster types. From my experience, especially on higher difficulties, the counter attack is your best friend. I'll admit one last thing: the difficulty level to the game is very rewarding. It will really push the player to their limits.

**Overall: One of the best games out there, but never got the attention it deserved. After playing God of War & Dante's Inferno, LOS outclasses them on so many levels. It's game that may have clone mechanics of its genre, but it also has a lot heart if you give it a chance.",Most Underrated Game of 2010,1338508800,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The problem though it's one of those games that does not really end.  There are end states that result from certain success criteria being met.  However they just sort of happen after your move is over and are never the result of a climax of some epic event.

4.0,True,"04 4, 2006",AKMJJES6FE2M5,B000CA5GL6,Andrew C.,"As a big fan of real-time strategy (RTS) games, I found this game to be a bit more than the average base-building, resource-collecting fare. To be sure, there is a lot of this kind of activity required in the game, but it is presented in a way that does not seem bland or too conventional. The game does not break a lot of new ground for the genre like, say, Dawn of War or Rise of Nations, but it does offer an interesting spin.

Gameplay: There are a few options here that should keep most players preoccupied for a while. First, there is the campaign mode that allows for play as either the good or evil side. Each of the campaigns have eight scenarios which for the most part are your standard base-building, land-conquering variety. Overall, the missions are well done and are a great introduction to the other gameplay options. Another gameplay mode is the War of the Ring. This is a mix of turn-based and real-time gaming in which factions try to take over a map of Middle Earth by moving armies around. It is a very well-done gaming mode that should allow for a lot of replayability. Thirdly, there is a skirmish mode as well as online play. The game comes with several maps, but unfortunately there is an overabundance of 2-player maps and a shortage of larger maps (only one 8-player map).

Each of the six playable races (men, elves, dwarves, Mordor, Isengard, and goblins) feels unique enough to offer a range of gameplay options. Each has several units, many upgrades, unique powers, various heroes, and other perks. Also, the game ships with a ""create-a-hero"" template that allows you to create your own in-game hero. This options, while a good idea, is rather limited in regard to the appearance of your hero. Heroes are better implemented in this game than in other RTS games (like Warcraft 3) and can level up without having to hunt down ""creeps"" or perform other distracting tasks. I assume that a future patch will adjust some of the heroes so that they are better balanced against each other.

The gameplay itself is very frenetic and engaging, and on medium and higher difficulties, the fighting starts early. The game's AI is generally good and will make it a point to destroy your buildings at every opportunity, along with your units. Occasionally, I've witnessed a few lapses with the AI, such as cases in which enemy units were not immediately noticed and attacked. Otherwise, the AI holds its own in most fights.  I've only noticed a few flaws in the game, but they are worth commenting upon. First, buildings and walls are far too weak and easily destroyed. Since games are won or lost based on your resource and unit output, it's a shame that a few infantry units can destroy an upgraded fortress in seconds. Of course, lesser structures like farms go down even quicker. Also, the game is not really geared toward epic siege warfare, which was one of the great things about the movies. Walls are not only weak but they are far to expensive to be practical and are difficult (perhaps impossible?) to repair. Additionally, the resource model encourages you to spread your farms apart for maximum benefit, so there is little possibility of having a compact, well-fortified, walled-in base. A patch could correct much of this (such as the strength and cost of buildings and walls), which would allow for more strategic and tactical possibilities such as siege warfare (requiring actual siege weapons) and turtling. There is naval warfare in the game, which is generally done well. However, very few maps allow it.

Graphics: This is a great-looking game. Lots of attention to detail in the environment as well as in the models. Unit animations, explosions, magical effects, weather, and other visuals are very convincing. The cutscenes for the campaigns are based on the game models and some wonderful paintings. The animations are not quite as dramatic and visceral as those of Dawn of War, but they are nonetheless quite good. And there are a lot of them. It never gets old seeing Tom Bombadil punching foes in the face or summoning the terrible wrath of a Balrog. Even common occurrences, such as Roharrim cavalry mowing down infantry, are always good for a smile. The game does require a decent computer to get the most out of the visuals. I have a mid-range machine (P4 3.0ghz, 1GB of RAM, Geforce 6600GT) and still get a bit of lag when there are a lot of units fighting on screen. However, EA went the extra mile on graphics, and it really paid off.

Sound: Everything is in order in this department. There are a lot of spoken sound-bites for each of the races, along with appropriate sounds for monsters, weapons, building construction, explosions, magical effects, and so on. The epic music from the movies plays in the background to set the atmosphere. All of the auditory elements of the game serve their purpose well.

Replayability/Technical Issues: The game should have a decent shelf life for RTS gamers, assuming that EA supports it with patches and an occasional bonus map. A map editor is available for download at the official website (www.bfme2.ea.com). The manual that comes with the game is decent, but the in-game tutorials are better. The game has been pretty stable for me with no installation issues. It did crash twice between turns in the War of the Ring mode. However, this was no big deal since I had been playing for several hours and had recently saved the game.

Overall, if you like RTS games, this is a good purchase. The Collector's Edition comes with a bonus DVD that has vignettes about how the game was made, cutscenes, the soundtrack, and a few other things. Also, this edition includes a few bonus items such as a dragon and extra maps.  It's probably worth the extra dollars for anyone who liked the movies.

I figured that once and for all, Microsoft would get the wonky D-pad issue right this time with this cool feature where the directional cross is more pronounced when you twist it.  The response to typical down/back, down/forward, etc. for fighter games were not pleasing. My D-pad almost squeaks a bit when moved left or right.  I actually had better luck with the D-pad without the directional cross being exclusive. The battery pack was worth it since it fits perfectly on the controller and I don't have to worry about recharging more double-A batteries.

The Bad: Some control and clipping issues, extremely repetitive missions, not very diverse visually, crowd simulation gets predictable and repetitive

Nothing is true. Everything is permitted. This is a saying heard throughout Assassin's Creed and it really sticks with you. So does the thick plot that has come to take the game industry by storm as well as one of the greatest game characters of all time: Altair. The plot is actually weird at first because it's a sci-fi story. You are actually Desmond Miles capture by modern world Templars. They stick you in an Animus and use your DNA to access your ancestors memories to find the Piece of Eden which can be used to control people's minds. That one ancestor is Altair set during the crusades. The second story is of Altair who ends up losing his rank and status among the Assassin Brotherhood by failing a mission due to eagerness and stupidity. Your master, Al Mualim, sends on special missions to assassinate key leaders throughout the holy land (Acre, Jerusalem, and Damascus) to keep them from taking the Piece of Eden and using it to win the war.

As you can see the plot is very interesting with a lot of twists. How is the game though? You have a huge open world that are full of side missions and hundreds of buildings to climb. Assassin's Creed has a parkour climbing system as well as a puppeteering system. You control each of Altair's limbs in two different states. The ""socially acceptable"" state allows you to use eagle vision which can show enemies and key targets. You can gently push people away from you and this is key because is you're running around the city knocking people over the guards will come after you, and towards the end of the game everyone is highly suspicious of you and just a few people knocked over will have the entire guard on your tail. The third thing is obviously combat, but if you hold down the run button you start climbing buildings, grabbing people to toss them, and jumping around.

Assassin's Creed really tried to introduce crowd psychology into the game and it works here, but does feel limited. If you climb buildings people will react by stopping and staring and saying things accordingly. If you use ladders people don't mind so much. While using rooftops is faster and keeps you away from most guards you must watch out for guards on rooftops who will shoot you with arrows if you don't get down, kill them, or move away quickly. The climbing works well enough, but there are some controls issues, clipping issues, and other issues with the camera. When Altair is facing a different way then the camera he will jump towards his way instead of the way you're telling him too. Also, if you run around a pole or near a crate he'll start climbing it instead of just jumping over or going around. This can get down right frustrating when you are running away from a dozen guards and trying to find a hiding spot.

The game also introduces anonymity via a symbol near your health bar which stays white when no ones suspects you, but will turn yellow when you are watched and flash red when guards are on to you. When it does this get away quickly or kill whomever is watching you. Don't just kill out in the open or people will run around screaming and call guards. Get away from dead bodies quickly because guards will come by and try to find who killed them or citizens will give you away. If you are caught you need to kill all guards after you or hide. To do this you must break their line of sight and the symbol will flash yellow. When it does find a hiding spot quickly before it turns red again. You can hide on benches between people, stacks of hay, in groups of monks praying, or draped boxes on rooftops. Stay there for a few seconds and you will by anonymous again. You can avoid all this chaos by just jogging, staying calm, don't flail around and jump around like a monkey in crowded areas etc.

This whole crowd system is really something else and works well, but feels repetitive and predictable because of the recycled sayings, animations, and it always happens the same way. The combat is the same way because while you can gain new abilities it feels like a counter fest. You can attack with a sword or short sword, throw daggers, but most guards always block and you just stand there with the block button held down and wait for someone to attack and then counter which is usually an instant kill. This gets repetitive and the combat isn't as deep as it could be since combos are limited, and animations are repeated often. It does control well and feels smooth so I guess that's better than broken.

The most repetitive thing, and the game's biggest flaw, are the constantly repeated missions that repeat dozens and dozens of times. You can save citizens, do some time trial flag gathering missions, escort missions, assassination missions (probably the most fun), interrogation, eavesdropping, pickpocketing, and climbing tall buildings to find view points to put more missions on your map in that area. Sure they are fun at first, but after you have saved the 30th citizen, or climbed the 50th building it gets old and you just want it to end. Some more mission diversity would have been nice.

While its cool to be an assassin, sneaking up behind a guard and shoving a punch dagger in his gut, and then running away while he falls to the ground without anyone suspecting otherwise is satisfying you must look good doing it too. Assassin's Creed looks amazing, even today, and the PC version sports DirectX 10 graphics with some slightly higher resolution textures. The game looks a lot better than console versions and is well worth another play through just for that alone. While the graphics are amazing technically, artistically the game feels very Middle Eastern with a great soundtrack to support that, voice acting, and the whole game feels true to its time. The architecture is great, the clothing, lifestyles, and jobs people do in the game, but it all does kind of look the same with a lot of greys, browns, and whites.

Overall Assassin's Creed is an amazing experience with a story you will talk about long after you finish the game, great crowd simulation, and the true feeling of being an assassin. If there was some more mission diversity, visual diversity, and smoother controls the game would be perfect.

Five different alternate timelines and sets of characters is enough to make the mind boggle alone, but the fact that most of those timelines feature at least 5 games to their credit is downright daunting.

That said, X8 is a true reward for true fans--if you've stuck by the Blue Bomber for this long and managed to endure hiccups like X6 and X7, then you're probably a worthy candidate for this game.  If not, well, as with most Mega Man games, it's really not going to offer much in the way of newness.  The basic formula here hasn't changed since Mega Man 8-bit debut on the NES in 1987--pick a boss, go through his stage, kill said boss, retrieve said boss's special weapon, and use it to kick the crap out of the next boss you pick.  It's dressed up in a nicer suit now than when the series first debuted, to be sure, but it's the same thing underneath.

Straight-up platform gaming done right is always, by its very definition, a challenge.  Such is the case with this game--even on its Normal mode, the learning curve is fairly steep.  On Hard mode, unless you know the boss's patterns from rote, it's nearly impossible to get anywhere.

The developers have added a little bit to the title in terms of replayability by inserting scores of secret items in the levels that you'll have to work very diligently to find, but this doesn't do quite enough to make it a lasting experience.  The most fun bit by far is that you can save your clear data from a game that you beat into a new file to play the game over again, but this time with your upgraded weapons and such already intact.  It's a big help when you start into a game on Hard mode.

The voice acting is actually quite good this time around also.  Seems as if Capcom has finally settled on X, Zero, and Axl's voices being fairly teenage in nature--in fact, the only really grating voice in the game is that of one of the new ""navigators"" (a support character who gives you tips throughout the level).

So the overall point, I guess, is don't pick this up unless you like an old-school challenge.  You will, most likely, die.  A lot.",Everything X7 should have been,1124755200,12,,

The controls work well.  The audio is easy to understand.  The game is so bright and shiny.  So, as I had hoped, I was happy.
So what do I not like about the game?  Well, after playing for an hour or so, the game kind of starts to get old.

I did say everything is bright and shiny.  But, if you get close to something and really look at it, there really is no depth.  No texture.  No shading, just a bland color.  That was a real let down.  From a game that I have heard, over and over, looks so great.

This game is very fast paced.  You hardly ever sit still.  It is intense, but it kind of gets annoying.  I just want to run around and stop when I choose, but, the only way to really survive while killing the bad guy is to move, non-stop.  My mind has to spend far to much time trying to figure out where the hell I am going to jump to next to really pay attention to anything on the ground.  The two counter act each other.  If that were not annoying enough, some of the time, there is a guy talking to you, telling you about new things that are happening.  Ive no clue what the guy has said to me at any point thus far.  I mean, I have no clue about the upgrades or the energy or any of those things, which would seem important.  You do not have the time to listen to the man talk, when you are trying to figure out where to grind next.

You are in such a big city.  Yet, the enemy really seem to be all clustered in a group.  You will just see large numbers of them with a few stragglers here and there.  It feels like a game Ive played on another system that was a huge let down.  I shall not say the name of that game.  It just seems a bit empty is all.

So, I sit here wondering what I should do.  Do I give the game, which in some ways, is fun.  Easy to control and hear.  Exciting and heart pounding a 4, or do I give it a five because it seems very much like an arcade game?  I have decided, that since I have played for such a short time, I would give it a 3.8 out of 5.  So, I rounded it up to a 4.  I just got another game for another system.  I am hooked on that.  As interesting as this new One game seems, I just do not feel excited to play it right now.  But still, I will stick with a 3.8.",Interesting,1416441600,,,
4.0,True,"11 6, 2014",A1MJS1YRKNMU04,B0050SYUAS,Grrgoyl,"I am probably a mid level athlete -- somewhere between couch potato and personal trainer.  Staying active is important to me, but not enough to commit to a structured regimen.  And I've learned, if exercise isn't fun I simply won't do it.

With that in mind, I started YSFE by avoiding setting any kind of objective, based on other reviews that said doing so creates flagged workouts that are the only ones that count in your progress.  I opted instead to browse as the whim took me to see what works for me and what doesn't.

First impression:  They must have fixed something in the update, because this is definitely one of the better games for Kinect recognition.  It's also one of the most forgiving for my tiny (6 feet, and that's being EXTREMELY optimistic) play space.  When shopping, it was a toss-up between this and the Wii Active Life games, but I was turned off by the pad controller that limited movement and apparently flopped around.  I'm very glad I went for this one.

I started with the warm-ups (naturally), which are a bunch of mini-games and the main reason I was attracted to YSFE (I vastly prefer exercises disguised as games, like the Sports and Adventures! titles).  I have to say, if you did nothing else on the disc, these provide a pretty good workout on their own, getting your heart rate up quickly and starting a burn in your muscles (unless you're already ripped, in which case these might be boring and too simple for you).  They are short, but as I'm not in prime condition they're long enough to have me more than grateful for the breaks for menu selections.

The main workouts are broken up into sections, first by body part, second specialized programs (cardio boxing, boot camp, dance classes, yoga, etc).  The first day for some reason I was drawn to the Bollywood dance class.  I own Zumba Fitness Rush, and by comparison this is much easier.  There's plenty of time to learn the moves slowly, although my first attempt at full speed was a bit disastrous.  But I'm not a dancer.  So I jumped over to Cardio Boxing, and I wish I'd started here.  This is like an extremely simplified Tae-Bo class, which I appreciate as I never got into Tae-Bo because it started at level 11 and only got worse from there.  I did some of the intro moves, and by now I was tired and sweaty enough that I called it a night (the game has one of the best reasons for working out at home -- a trainer who evaporates the second you're done and doesn't hang around for awkward small talk).

The next morning I was seriously achy, which made me very happy.  Means I did some work.  I spent the entire day looking forward to working out.  If that doesn't speak highly of a product, I don't know what does.

So day two I did my favorite warm-up activities and tried out a focused exercise on abs.  The sensor lost me on the floor a little, so I moved it closer to the edge of its little shelf (cursing out Microsoft all the while -- whose brilliant idea was it to make a gaming system that only works in massive living spaces?)  This fixed it enough to finish the set.  I haven't looked at the other focused workouts yet because this is my least favorite way of exercising, repetitious sets of movement for no reason apart from performing the movement.  Boring.

I went back to the cardio boxing and it was still great fun.  The graphics are really good in showing you what's expected, and again they add new moves slowly, giving you time to perfect the old ones first.  It reminded me a little of my kung-fu class in college.  (Edit:  I've since tried out the Humana section called ""Strengthen Your Heart,"" which is more boxing, only here you repeat one move 5 or 6 times and then move onto the next, rather than having one long complicated routine.  Halfway through you go back and do the first half again.  This entire section lasts about 13 minutes and really got me sweating.)

Then a ""Zen Energy"" cooldown (Tai Chi.  Just call it Tai Chi), which was surprisingly far less forgiving than the more rapid exercises (though I suppose form is much more important for that discipline).

I was again satisfyingly sore after day two.

I think some older reviews complained about non-cumulative calorie counts and having to manually track them.  This has been fixed and total calories burned are remembered day to day (this isn't as important to me.  I measure success by tired aching muscles).

My one complaint, since nothing is perfect, is my appearance on the screen.  Either I have a severe self-misperception (entirely possible) or the scanner somehow manages to add ten pounds.  Maybe this is a subtle way to keep you motivated.  Fortunately once the workout gets going you're more focused on other parts of the screen other than yourself. (Edit:  Second complaint.  Last night had to tap out of a routine temporarily.  As long as the sensor detects even a little bit of you in range, it continues on as if you were still performing the moves, complete with encouraging praise.  Makes me doubt its sincerity if it can be that effusive to just my elbow sitting at the edge of the screen.)

I haven't tried playing this with a friend yet, though if it's true that things have to be done in turns rather than simultaneously this is a big design flaw. (Edit:  It's true, no simultaneous play.  Though might be a blessing in disguise in my tiny space, to avoid injury.)

In summary, I understand other users' frustration that there's no way to just set up a 30-minute workout and do it straight through, but I'm easily bored and like the fact that you can jump around and do only the exercises you're in the mood for.  I like that there's a large variety of workouts (although wish there were more mini-games.  If anyone knows of other titles that sneak in a workout while you think you're just playing a game, feel free to comment).  And I like that they seem to be highly effective, as far as ""feeling the burn"" the next day.  (Edit:  Burn confirmed.  After the first week I seriously needed a day off, I was so sore.  Again, a good thing.  If these workouts don't kick your butt, at least a little, then you don't need an Xbox game, you need a fully equipped gym with treadmills, weight machines and stair climbers.)

That has been the case with virtual pets and Pokemon. Going back to the 90's, that has been a very popular trend. Although many peopl have honestly thought that was definitely going to fail. Ironically, when Nintendo released the DS system last year, they just really haven't found a game that would definitely appeal to all ages. Although they have had some good games like Meteos, a revised edition of Super Mario 64, there just hasn't been something for all pet lovers to really enjoy. Now, there is something for them to enjoy.

Nintendogs for the Nintendo DS, is the latest answer to virtual pets. The game features a variety of loveable dogs that you can make them do tricks, roll over, and chase their tails. The dogs are vurtually adorable and have the unique appeal you'd see dogs have in any pet store. The graphics in the game really do come out very well, within each detail of all of the canines, while the music might be cutesy and sometimes too annoying. The control for all of the editions is very simple to maintain within the stylus, and definitely can be maintained simply with the turn of the hand. With each dog, you can also get special treats like collars, and pet toys and make them do special tricks for more funds as well.

All in all, when I got to try the demo edition of this game, I honestly thought this would be very interesting to try and own. I was right. Nintendogs is a great game for all Nintendo DS owners young and old, and for those who want a dog, but just simply can't afford it.

It does exactly what I want it to, and nothing extra.

I love the 'no software needed' method they have of doing it - but the weird online site you have to use to test the hz is kind of annoying. A simply interface or an additional tiny led on the mouse to show hz would have been great. But it is such a good mouse. I can see why all the ""pros"" use it, or have at some point used it - its amazing.

The materials on it, the plastics, feel a bit 'dated' at first. Compared to the soft touch plastics of SteelSeries and Razer it feels a bit on the cheaper side. That said, I don't actually miss the rubber materials on the side with this mouse. When you compare it, it feels dated, but once you start using it the materials are actually really really good. I can hold it firm, its comfortable, and it doesn't get all ""slidey"" when the hands get sweaty.

It completely ruined my first few hours with this mouse, because it is such a good mouse. After 2 days of messing around with it (every 2 minutes it seemed) I have it at the point that its ok now. I just packed my deathadder up, and the braided cable on that has none of these issues.

I'm giving BenQ ZOWIE the benefit of the doubt that this is just an old design that hasn't been touched. But it is ridiculous that such a small thing like the cord could have such a bad effect on the user experience of what is otherwise, one of the best products in it's market.

Yeah, the graphics are uninspired: sparsely animated dungeons flicker repetitive images, and the outside field scenes don't exactly conjure images of the middle age peasantry. However, there is a great deal to uncover in the game, and personally, the ability to look down on the ground with your character (or up in the air) is appealing to me, as it allows for more varied battles.
As for the battles, they are standard King's Field fare: hack and slash. However, finally the AI for the monsters has improved, as you are not allowed merely to circle the enemy and constantly stay out of his weapon range (now, enemies can attack behind them). My one problem here is that many enemies do not continue pursuit of you; they will circle back after a time, allowing for some ridiculous moments.
A big plus to the game is the immensity of the world. Also, secrets abound, and if you wish to find good weaponry or armor, you must try to seek out these hidden treasures (you can buy weapons, but they are very poor).

Alan Wake is not your badass dude who is used to things attacking him, or him even using a gun. - Alan Wake is a writer from New York,who goes on vacation with his wife to get away and relax, but some weird stuff starts to happen. He wakes up a week after he arrives, in his crashed car, in the middle of he woods. He soon finds the cover page to a manuscript that seems to be written by him but he has no recollection of writing it at all, as well as the manuscript he finds a flashlight and gun.-

That's when the action starts you realize that you have to hold the flashlight on these things that are attacking you, the game calls them taken, until they burst with light then you fill them full of lead, this is good way to make the games shooting feel different and at some times scarier. The shooting feels fine l, the problem with it is that there is a lot of it and it all feels the same, there are different weapons like a shotgun, a hunting rifle, you even find some more unconventional weapons like flashbangs and flares. There isn't very much verity to the enemies other than they get bigger and some of them start to charge. I don't care how cool it sounds, but shooting a lumberjack made of darkness very much so does get boring. they do start to throw in objects that start to attack you, like straight from a Stephen King novel. actually they reference him when this starts to happen.

The game is in a episodic format, but not like you would think you don't buy the game piece meal; telltale style, but you get all the episodes they just pace it like a television show. Which lets them do a lot of cool stuff with how they end each episode with just a bang that really just want to make you keep going. each episode takes about 2 hours there are 6 episodes so do the math. Remedy knows how to really flesh out a world feel like there is stuff just aways happening, they make it feel really lived in. Around the world you'll find these radios and TVs. each radio has a segment from this late night radio host you meet very early in the game. Who takes calls from the people of Bright Falls, and they all seem to be talking about stuff that you did or had some part in, and the TVs have this great TVs call Nightsprings which is a really good rip off of The Twilight Zone, but some of them have these videos of you freaking out in the cabin you were staying.

This all comes together to make a really store that has some neat twist and turns through out it, the combat might get dull about half way through, because they don't really introduce anything new, you have basically seen all the enemies and fought them many times at that point. I still really liked that writing and the whole world they introduce you into.","Great, but gets dull",1336003200,,,

Many of the reviews were based on people who raced to get to the highest levels without enjoying the immersion of the detailed world and the quests, or who stopped playing before most of the current fixes were put in place.

When the game came out, there were huge issues with memory leaks, crashes, etc.  Those are 99% fixed now and the game is maturing quite well, especially under the leadership of the new game director.  There have also been vast improvements to the combat - much more interactive than other games - and balancing the playable classes.  New content has been added for some of the slow points while leveling, and existing content has been tuned and enhanced.

Additionally, the PvP system has been reworked to include a criminal system with consequences.  People who enjoy killing characters of lower level will find they cannot receive most quests, can only resurrect at criminal camps, and must pay black marketers and smugglers for services that other characters get for free; they can perform redeemer quests to lose criminal status, but until they do they will be attacked by guards stationed near rez points and quest givers.  Ganking isn't dead, but it's a lot less common now.

After playing the first game, I really expected a lot from the sequel, so this is why I have been re-evaluating the game's overall score.  From start to finish, I was paying more attention to the audio messages and looking for clues that might give me an insight of the new plot.  I have to admit this was not my strong suit in the first game, so I was hoping to figure out the plot twist before it would happen.  There were times when I thought I had it figured and realized I wasn't even close.  The game never had a plot twist like the original and I finished the game quite suprised by this fact.  The game was rather linear and rushed at times.  At any rate, I felt cheated by the ending.  Overall, I enjoyed returning the the crazy world of Rapture.

Good Points:  I loved the duel welding ability, and I enjoyed the upgrades for the plasmas.  Telekinesis was always my favorite plasma in the first game, so it was great to upgrade it to a point where I could pick up living splicers and toss them.  As far as weapons go, I liked the new additions (rivet gun, drill etc) and my favorite weapon is the spear gun.  My wife thinks I'm crazy.

This game required more strategy (protecting the little sisters) which I rather enjoyed.

Investigating the splicers has always been one of my favorite parts of the game.  The video recorder is much better than the camera.  I found myself attacking a recorded splicer with creative combinations of plasmas and fire power.  From throwing splicers to barrels of gas, I never got tired of this.

Bad Points: I felt this game limited your creativity.  For example, you have the ability to pick up the dead splicer, but you can't pick up  and move an adam filled splicer that your little sister has identified.  There are many times in the game where the little sister has selected a splicer that is in a horrible location to protect.  I understand the designers attitude toward this, but I don't like it when a game is not consistent.

I understand the idea to have splicers show up in areas that were previously cleared, but this game had a bad approach.  It became apparent rather quickly that a splicer can just materialize anywhere, whether it makes sense or not.  In a game that requires you to strategize, it leaves you hanging in the common sense department.

I will now give the ""PROS"" and ""CONS"" of the game and even add a ""MID"" as in stuff I didn't hate but also didn't love, but you or others might feel different about it...

PROS:
The game play is clean and controls very well.
Has bots if you don't have online play or don't feel like playing online! :)
Great maps to play on and are very deep and thought out.
You can paint how their vehicles look and pick what weapon you want to use as your side arm.
The in game Soundtrack is AMAZING! it still has Rob Zombie in it and also has Sammy Hagar! 8D
It looks amazing and sounds great!

MIDS:
The story is short and you can only play 3 characters in it, BUT I did like their stories very much.
There could have been little more maps to play on... but I'm sure DLCs will help that.
Button controls for the game can be a little overwhelming at first, but you'll get the hang of it.

CONS:
I really don't like this having to hit every button to wake up from a freeze attack.
I also don't like how I have to flick my remote to get a even bigger boost...

Hands down this is THE GREATEST Twisted Metal EVER! I think this is what from start what Twisted Metal was supposed to be like when the first Twisted Metal game came out on PS1 and I have played them ALL and Loved them all...

The bots in the game are lot of FUN and has 2 to 4 player split screen and Co-Op. :) ...

The price point is on the high end like the Titanfall 2 and Battlefield 1 controllers. The main issue I have with the price is that these are wired. For $60 you can get a wireless from Microsoft.

The dungeon crawler aspect has been done many times, even with the ""collect items to rebuild the town"" feature.  Despite great graphics and gameplay, this familiarity brought down the game a few notches, in my opinion.
The game basically plays like this: You have a dungeon and a town accompanying it; to save the town, you must explore all the levels of the dungeon (usually around 15), defeat monsters, collect items, and rebuild the town as the townspeople see fit (by placing certain buildings in certain places).  A nice twist is the number of allies you can switch to after certain points in the game, rather than having the same character for the entire journey.

I don't know, it's just that today some of the titles require such high-end stats and make you wade through more menus that I yearn for the days of old when games were just much more straightforward. In addition there's just not that many single-player games in production these days and I remember a time when it was the single-player mode that a game was rated by, multi-player being more of a novelty.
Mechwarrior II:Mercenaries is a reasonable translation of tabletop BattleTech to computer gaming. I say ""reasonable"" because there are finer nuances that have been altered to make the computer gaming experience more palatable. More on that in a second, let's give this game it's due. Building on the slightly older Mechwarrior II and expansion pack this game gave you the viewpoint of the Inner Sphere (IS) domains. Coincidentally most BattleTech players I've ever dealt with play IS in one form or another, and so the first Mechwarrior II, while pretty, seemed a little odd. No Mechwarror game since this one has covered the Clan Invasion of 3051 and it's a crying shame, more classic combat scenarios came out of that era than any other, hands down.
You start out as a mercenary commander (your CO blown away in the awesome, totally BattleTech inspired intro). Over the years you acquire better Mechs and weapon systems, salvage partially destroyed equipment (and even more Mechs), and spend your money wisely upgrading. You can also hire up to 2 Lance mates, although as a BattleTech purist I really would have liked to have had 3, a Lance being 4 Mechs in number. You can also hire a single Aerospace fighter or bomber pilot, flying the classic 3025 models (Stukas, Lucifers, Corsairs, and more). As the game progresses your stature and fame in the IS grows, until strange stories come from the Periphery of a marauding army of souped up Mechs destroying all in thier path. In one of the most memorable game sequences I ever played (ever, to this day) you escape with some Periphery pirates (common enemies make strange bedfellows, eh?) and flee in a stolen Pegasus Light Hovercraft to a perfectly taut soundtrack.
The cutscenes were wonderful and the game exudes pure BattleTech. The new Mercenaries captures a lot of the dynamics of running an independent mercenary company in the BT universe but just doesn't take it from this era, which is a shame.
This game, good as it is, still has some flaws. If you flip through your 3025 manuals you'll see most of the Mechs are here, save for a few notable ones like the Rifleman, Warhammer, Phoenix Hawk, and my favorite, the Hatchetman. My understanding is there is an ongoing licensing problem with some of these designs, basically carbon copied from the RoboTech universe. Weapons don't seem to do as much damage, but I understand that's a necessary evil of the design. On a tabletop the average life expectancy of some units isn't even a full minute, and so while you may expect to obliterate that unwary Commando with your AC20 in one shot it's a little dissappointing to see it take up to 3. Your Lance members oftentimes don't know where they're going, although admittedly they can hit thier targets. The vaunted Aerospace Pilot works for only a few missions and then simply ceases to work, simply hovering in place over the battlefield, regardless of how many times you tell him to attack. And I won't lie, there are a number of impossible missions that will have you scouring the web looking for invulnerability cheats, the first and foremost on my mind being the set of missions on the ice freighter.

The game is EPIC, you cant get it any better, the intro and some other things in the game point towards the 300 movie, which I find it as a notch since I feel the 300 movie took some hints from the GoW.

The story is nothing new, you are Kratos in a quest for vengeance against Olimpus, especially against Zeus, in the way to archive that, you will find yourself solving puzzles and fighting epic battles.

The gameplay hasn't change that much, is almost intact and that is a good thing, you will feel right in home.

The music is epic and haunting sometimes, but totally cinematic, top notch musical score here as always.

The voice acting is right on the spot, Hades is my (new) favorite, very low end bass voice; Kratos is piss and loud as always.

The Graphics are out of this word, some people says that this character is more detailed than this other, but is not the same to have a huge Titan and a God creature fighting in the same stage (this is from the very beggining so no spoiler) than to have 35 undead creatures fighting kratos, Im sure those 35 undead HAVE to be less resolution and detailed to appear all on screen at the same time and to keep framerate stable (framerate on this game is tight 60fps), but nevertheless those undead show damage as the fight progress some loose armor parts and its pretty cool to look at.

The Backgrounds (huge stages), characters and specially Kratos are out of this word, the Titans are huge and you are fighting ON them, the scale here is incredible, camera zooms in and out letting you know the stage is enormous, incredibly there are not one loading except when you are loading your game but thats it, after that is just nonstop gameplaty. If you are looking for top notch graphics, this is the game.

Extras, there are plenty of those, from ""making of"" to specific areas of the development like concept art, creation of specific characters, music or voice acting (my favorite so far).
You unlock also the Challenges and extra customs.

At the end there could be things that some people may dislike, other people where waiting for more (!) but for me this is a good balanced game, with tons of epic action, your average GoW story and unparalleled graphics.

What would've been great is the thrid person view of your character.  Also, the game has cartoonish graphics, and althoug violent, makes the game look like a second-rate action RPG.

The town characters in the game really do not interact with you, they're practically static sprites who will talk to you only to give out a mission or reward you for one.  Aside from that, you really don't interact with them and it's all about the shooting and #$s kicking, which again although cartoonish is crude and your characters plain cold assassins.

A little more thought into the story would be more rewarding for the gameplay, as the game often turns repetitive with just shooting hoards and hoards of enemies with really no different skill than using some elemental weapon of choice or getting them in the head.

Aside from that, if you liked Fallout 3, don't expect this title to exceed Fallout 3 in any aspect of the game.  It's truly simplistic and apt for a tad more lazy minds who like more action than reading some story line, as happens in Fallout 3.

The options that you are given and the control setup is great, the graphics seem to be less than that of ""Return to Castle Wolfenstein"".

4.0,False,"10 9, 2008",A3E68QNSCABRVW,B000067DPM,Gradient Vector Field,"Let me preface this by saying this game is awesome!  So why four stars?  Mostly because of some systemic issues that I came across and one thematic reason that didn't fit well with me.  Other than that this game is simply brilliant.  Taking Star Wars into the realm of role playing was obviously a great idea.  The tabletop game looks fun as it is, but to branch into the realm of video games, I suspect, is just as fun.  I've played Star Wars games on and off since ""Dark Forces II"" came out years ago, but I wouldn't say I'm an absolutely die hard fan of them.  However, I'm hoping ""Knights of the Old Republic"" will spawn a long running string of similarly designed Role Playing games!

RPG's are probably my favorite format for video games (I still haven't decided if I really like them more than FPS or if they simply tie).  The game that really got me into RPG's was Diablo and it's because it didn't use the very common turn based system that was used in games like Final Fantasy.  Now a huge amount of RPG's released over the years have followed this kind of methodology in copying the fast paced Diablo format where the user gets to hack away at enemies in a button mashing frenzy.  ""Knights of the Old Republic"" uses more of a turn based combat system.  Which I really didn't think I would like at first, but I didn't mind it to much in this one.  It gives you the time you need to setup your attacks and choose force powers if you want to use them in combat.  Some people might find this boring because you don't have to really physically participate in the combat, instead simply watch your character execute the moves, but I still managed to enjoy my time in this game.  At least I get to manually control where my character goes and whom I interact with.  I personally found the game play enjoyable.

Another major plus for this game is that you definitely get your moneys worth!  I logged nearly 60 hours in my process of completing this game and you can play the game multiple ways!  Basically if you play it as a Dark Side character you get different options than you would a Light Side character, and each side has different endings.  This at least makes it worthwhile to play through the game twice logging approximately 120 hours of game play in all!  This, of course, is provided it doesn't go faster the second time around... which it probably will take less time.

Anyway, I played through the game as Dark Side and this is where my initial hang-up came in.  Based on the movies and other things I've read in the Star Wars universe I just didn't feel like they really captured the ethos of the Dark Side.  In this game you had to do randomly cruel actions in order to earn Dark Side points and I really didn't like that.  While the Dark Side is unforgiving and cruel, I don't feel it's a chaotic cruelty.  It's more of a measured cruelty that's motivated by a need for power.  Arbitrary cruelty doesn't really have much of a result in this game, you don't gain anything from it (other than Dark Side points) and I just think that doesn't work towards the true Dark Side motivations.  Now I've played both ""Knights of the Old Republic"" games and I really liked two better in this regard.  I think it captured the Dark Side much more correctly.  Whereas in this one it's very difficult to actually play as a Dark Side character most of the time.  In some situations I didn't have any option, but to give an answer that yielded me Light Side points and this just seemed stupid to me because my character was so heavily weighted to the Dark Side at that time.  Not to mention one of the major ways you earn Dark Side points is by being mean to your own team, this just seemed foolish.  If you were really Dark Side you wouldn't be blatantly mean to the team you were leading, you would coax them into wanting more power or vengeance etc.  This doesn't come into play until the second half.  The only time I really felt like I was truly playing a Dark Side character was when the big plot twist was revealed, after that I got very heavily into the story line and moved this game up a notch in my rating scale.  (Very very VERY awesome plot twist by the way!)

The second issue I had with the game was how heavily laden the game was with glitches.  Now I tried playing through it on my Xbox 360, so you'd think the game would actually process smoother, not so at all.  It is especially jumpy during talking sequences between characters and it has an extremely difficult time processing a battle with a large amount of enemies.  This becomes detrimental in the later battles on the Star Forge where you have to fight through so many Sith that the system can barely process all the blaster fire and light saber duels!  Now, I also tried playing this game on my original Xbox a long time ago and basically what happened there is it had an in game error and crashed the whole system.  My original Xbox never worked again and I had to purchase a new one, thus I played this on the 360 to hopefully avoid that.  Well, the glitches are still rife throughout my game play, but at least it didn't destroy my Xbox this time.  (Please note:  The game more than likely didn't destroy my original Xbox, but probably had more to do with its age and the amount of use it had received over the years.  I just have a natural fear now that it happened!)

Overall this is an incredibly good game.  It's pretty well thought out and probably a superb game if you play as a Light Side character, because the story-line probably has a much better flow.  You visit multiple worlds throughout this game and each world is simply HUGE.  It's one of the reasons it takes so long to play the game, especially if you like to play a game thoroughly like me (i.e. making sure every inch of a map is shown).  Again, the major flaw, to me, aside from the programming glitches, was the Dark Side story line is lacking.  Anyway, I think the processing would have been superior on a PC at this point.  I would definitely list this as one of my must play RPG's, because despite it's flaws it really is that fun and if you're a die hard Star Wars fan, I doubt you'll be disappointed.",This is but a taste of the Dark Side...,1223510400,4,,

The things that rock about this game are the depth of extras. The main story is alright, and to be honest, I enjoyed that it was different then usual. Those goody goody parents may be put off by the demons thingy, but the game isn't for kids anyways.(mainly because it is so complex)
Items are literally dungeon portals, which let you powerup other items, and gain levels. The Dark Assembly is alright, yet you don't need to know it to win the game. The Geosystem is what confuses me most. Sometimes I think I do something then bam something else happens. You don't even need it though.
FFTactics has a great story, which I loved mostly because of the characters. The characters in this game are annoying rather. Im fine with most of the characters, except the main one, laharal. His voice is annoying.
The battles in this game involve alot more special techniques, combos which are alright, and different weapon types. I enjoy seeing guns AND swords in a game, and that was a great addition. The battles themselves are pretty easy, I just build up laharal and have absolutely no problems. I enjoy it though. It is relaxing to play a game that doesn't require every minute clicking. You can sit back, set up your commands, and execute when your ready. Disgaea provides a relaxing game rather then a frustrating one.
FFT would sometimes leave you in tremendously hard battles. Those who have played it can agree probably that the battle in the castle, against that one special someone who turns into a demon is wayyyy too hard. You know, you have to be a knight or samurai with Ramza, you kill him off alone then he spawns into this demon minatour with 3 bodyguards and can kill everyone in one shot. I got over the battle after restarting from the beggining a few times. Disgaea gives a rather enjoyable setting, with good depth but not too hard.
The main problems I have with Disgaea are slight. The music is annoying now. I am so tired of that castle song. The comedy is dry, I have never laughed at anything in the game, and I have a great sense of humor. Even with a spoiled brat running around, you can't make someone laugh with pure stupidity every time. O look the girl is an idiot, LOL LOL LOL!!!!!!11. Just kidding, it isn't funny anymore.  Demons sleep 2 years? thats funny, my characters seem to sleep about 2, no wait...3 hours. I'm not trying to go into huge detail, but I do like this game.
The one last thing I want to say is the biggest problem, complexity. The game can't avoid this. but there is alot to learn. and you probably will spend a good 15 minutes in the help menu, which is easily built in and can be accessed basically any time.
Is it worth the money? Yes it is. The game provides tons of battles, Huge levels(not like battle levels, im talking the levels your character can gain), 10000 I believe. On top of that, items are mini dungeons basically, characters have voice overs(japanese AND english), and there are plenty of special moves. You can learn moves off pupils. You can do combos. Shoot guns, bows, chop with axes, swords, staffs, and the occasional stabby ol' spear. I would reccomend this game to FFTactics lovers.",FFTactics vs. Disgaea,1064275200,5,,

I salivated at the thought of Far Cry 2, and wept in disappointment because I thought it was just so bad. So, when I read about Far Cry 3 last year, I sort of went ""meh."" It sounded exactly like the Far Cry I played 10 years ago, and besides, the last one sucked. So I decided against getting it.

Then, I ran out of games and Amazon had a great sale. I picked this up for under $20. I figured it was an acceptable risk in case it was a poor game, or just a rehash of the original. Glad I was wrong in my expectations - this game is really, really good. I thought for sure I would detest the hunting side games, which are necessary to increase the size of your weapon holsters (so you can carry up to 4 weapons), and I thought the game would quickly get tedious. Nope.

The open world nature of this game is truly awe-inspiring. You travel among various islands, killing pirates who have wronged you and your friends. The weapons are great. The environment is even better. Once, I was trying to stealth up behind two enemies walking down a road. Suddenly, a tiger came out of no where and killed them both. There are random acts of awesome things like that every where. I have accidentally fallen off cliffs, landed in deep water, and found new places to explore. I have thrown a molotov cocktail at one enemy, and watched as the ensuing fire engulfed the jungle, huts, and other enemies as it spread. The physics in this game are amazing to watch.

Best weapon? The bow. You can kill with stealth, but the real money shot is an arrow modified to have an explosive tip. A jeep full of enemies coming to kill you? Explosive arrow: it is just something you need to see to fully appreciate. You can drive the jungle roads (realistically I might add) in cars, jeeps, and ATV's. You can hang glide from tall cliffs. If you can see it, you can pretty much travel to it. Although Ubisoft marketed this game as ""Skyrim with guns!"" the open world really reminded me of the GTA series but in the jungle instead of the city. And, it has a decent story with quality voice acting.

Truth be told, if I had purchased this game when it came out last year for full price, I would have felt I got my money's worth. I am still glad I waited because it was even sweeter to pick it up so cheap. So, if you are a bit jaded in the FPS realm like I am, you might want to give this a try when it is next on sale. (although its current price of around $30 is still a great deal) You might be pleasantly surprised like I was.",GTA in the Jungle,1381708800,21,"{'Edition:': ' Standard - Steam DRM', 'Platform:': ' PC Download'}",
4.0,False,"01 14, 2008",A5ICXN2QWKEQU,B000TP2V3A,Bojangles,"I've been riding motocross bikes for 12 years and playing motocross games when the snow falls and I can't ride.

This game is fantastic! I've played several other motocross games by rainbow studios (and other game companies) and with each release they've improved by leaps and bounds (no pun intended).

The pros about this game:
-The motocross and atv content in the game is outstanding. If ALL you want to do is play MX or ALL you want to do is race Quads, then this is the game for you!

-You can race head to head quad vs. MX (but I find that the bikes are much faster!

-Rhythm is VERY important in this game, just like in real life. You can use your head to figure out the best line and carve it up. Should you mess up somewhere, there are other lines that will get you back in rhythm--FIND THEM!

-Each track is different and the jumps aren't made from a cookie cutter map designer. In other words, jumps have a variety of irregular and regular lips. Go over the lower part of the lip if you've got too much speed, or go over the higher part to clear that tripple jump!

-Seat bounce! You can get extra air by utilizing the suspensions compression and rebound at the jumps face. Very handy for clearing a jump if you simply can't get enough speed.

-Customize your gear, rider, and bike! Tons of mods.

-Rider views are great. Even the 1st person camera works decently well.

-Music is great

-Graphics are superb

-Physics are excellent

-Tail whip and 'scrub' feature

-Replay value is excellent. Because of the varying terrain, tacks, and race types/configurations I don't see myself ever getting tired of this game.

-Online play (I haven't tried this yet. I want to figure out the fastest lines for all the tracks first).

Cons: (Most of these could be fixed with a patch, should Rainbows step it up a little bit)
-You lose a TON of speed if you get t-boned. It sometimes feels like you're not planted to the ground when another mx bike or atv comes along and pushes you across the dirt. It feels like you're an air hockey puck and you just go from 40-50mph to like 10. It's bs. In real life you'd either bang handle bars and brush away or fall down.

-The music gets redundant. I must have played last night for about 2 hours. It was great but I wish I could add my own songs from my Xbox 360 or if Rainbow had added like 10 more to mix it up a bit more. Not a big problem, just trying to nitpick.

-The 1st person rider view could be improved a little bit more. I'd like to see more head movement so I could see the gas tank of the bike or to be able to look behind me (perhaps I haven't figured out the control). Either way, it's difficult to tell the pitch of the bike when landing a jump from the first person view.

-I keep wishing for a motocross game that allows for BIKE IMPROVEMENTS, i.e. increased horsepower. Remember those old Road Rash games? Where you started out on a 'rat bike' or a slower bike and worked your way up to a really fast pro bike? That's what this game needs. A career mode.

-Some of the atv tracks drive me nuts. I simply can't get the rhythm down or get enough speed or momentum to get over some of the jump faces--seat bounce or not. I'll figure it out I suppose, but fat, lumbering atv's aren't really my cup of tea.

-The tail whip could be improved slightly. It's great you can control that aspect now, but I was able to do that in Motocross Madness 2, where there was no such feature. Simply hit the brake in mid air and turn to the side. Tail whip. This game doesn't really make you hang loose in a tail whip. It's more mechanical looking and not as fluid as it should be. Still a rather small nit-pick from someone who actually has experience on the track.

-The replay mode. I was very disappointed I was unable to save my replays or pause it and move around the camera angles and take pictures. Rainbow Studios, you NEED this feature. Take a look at the game Forza 2. You can watch, control, (rewind!), change camera angles, AND TAKE A PICTURE which saves it to your Xbox's memory. This is great because you can show it to your friends and it's just a neat little feature. Plus I'd imagine it wouldn't be a bad way to get some free marketing since a bunch of people will be showing pictures of the game.

All in all, if you're a fan of off-road you shouldn't even be reading this far. You should be running (not walking) to get your credit card and swipe it right away and BUY THIS GAME. This game, simply put, is going to get much MUCH more game play than my Call of Duty or Halo 3 games.

Skyward Sword has been entertaining to play through, but it doesn't match the greatness seen in some of the other games.  The dungeons are phenomenal, with unique new puzzles that really require you to think, observe, and experiment more so than many of the previous games.  But it is the filler in between the dungeons that is the problem.

Much of the time spent playing the game is filled with menial fetch quests.  Go here and gather 15 of these.  Go there and gather 5 of those so you can fly back here and gather a few more things.  It's like a similar, expanded version of Twilight Princess' collecting the Tears of Light over and over throughout the game.  It's annoying, unoriginal, and not fun.  I get the impression that Nintendo purposely added these sections for the sole purpose of making the game longer.

Overall, it's still a very good game, but I really hope this isn't the direction that Nintendo will continue to take with the Zelda franchise.

I did not detect anything different from these games and their arcade counterparts, like some other die-hard game reviewers did. Like the Activision Anthology, this collection also has an 80s soundtrack of different songs to listen to while you're choosing your options. My favorites are the Pac Man and Pole Position games, Galaxian, Dig Dug and Xevious. I got into Mappy and Rally-X a little, they're fun ""cute type"" games. I tried Bosconian and Sky Kid a couple of times. In order to play the bonus games, you must achieve a high score on their related games. The instruction booklet does NOT say what those scores are.

Now the bad stuff. You can choose options (number of lives, etc.) but going from screen to screen seems to take a long time. It's like you're saying ""Come on already"" waiting for the next screen. Once the game starts, you must play it through. You can't go back to the beginning, though I believe you can pause the game if the phone or doorbell rings. When the game is over, you must start from the beginning. You can't pick up from the level you were at, which is annoying as all Hell. And like the others have said, other than the two bonus games, there's no special features like interviews or anything like that. It would've been nice, but oh well.

It takes place in New Mombasa right before Halo 3 and it has good things and bad. First off, it is not like any other Halo entries. Yes, it has Covenant, no Flood (Which I love because I HATE the flood), and the weapons everyone loves. However, the HUD is pretty different, and the location is monotonous if you don't know where to go. Second, you play as 'the Rookie' travelling the streets during the night and search the city to find out what happens from drop to leaving the pod. When you find a clue or out of place object, you play as another member of the squad, and their personal experiences that explain what that particular item is doing there.

The previous installement of the Devil May Cry series offered 85% of all the content in this special edition. Simply put, if you have the previous Devil May Cry 3, it's probably not a very good idea to purchase this greatest hit edition, because it does not add enough to make the game so much more enjoyable. Yes, throwing in a special character was a pretty interesting twist, and those who are tired of the old hero will like battling it out with another character through the other view of the Good VS. Evil plotline, but because the mechanics of this new character are extremely similar, most will grow bored of this semi-dante copy quickly.

  Other little features in this game such as the few new items for Dante and the unlockable videos, pictures and such aren't too important. So if one would like to experience something new in this edition of Devil May Cry 3, they're out of luck.  However, if you do not own the original Devil May Cry 3, this is definetly the version for you. The price is almost the same, and you'll be getting a bit more, anyway. Regardless, the gameplay, sound, graphics, story, and value of the game hasn't changed. It's still boasts great visuals, intruiging plotline, and the fun, fast gameplay the previous game offered.

Bottomline.

Graphics: Capcom has always worked hard to make their games look magnificent, and this is no exception.

Gameplay: As said, fast, action packed, just really fun stuff here. Alot of veriety.

Sound: Sountrack is hardcore, and fits the game perfectly. However, it is slightly repetitive. The voice overs are great too, as always.

Story: You'll be interesting in this game because of its great plotline. While it is slightly cliche with its ""battle of demons"" type theme, its quite entertaining none the less.

Lasting Appeal: If you played and completed the previous game, this will only keep you occupied for another 10 or so hours, just to see how it's like with the new playable character. But because it's all so similar, you'll stash it away somewhere quite quickly. Newcomers will love this game, however.

The mic is good, and those i talk to online have said it is very clear and sharp. The cable is nice, but short (comes with an extender). The sound is okay.

You may have heard of some movies they were in or maybe a catchy them song they had...Who knows.  But if you ever longed for a third movie in the franchise and/or ever wanted to be a Ghostbuster yourself you just might enjoy this game.

First, the obvious comparison to Xbox / Play Station - yes the Wii version is more of a cartoony quality and not realistic character models.  However, this does not detract from the playability and fun of the game.  I also understand there are some small differences in story and level design but I cannot comment fully on those.  This review is for the Wii version.

Voice work - The voice work on this game is top notch especially as it applies to the four main characters, Venkmen (Bill Murray), Egon (Harold Ramis), Ray (Dan Aykroid) and Winston (Ernie Hudson ) who are, as you can see, are voiced by the men who made them famous.  They talk and quip throughout the game and cut scenes with characteristics just like those of their screen counterparts with Egon's scientific jargon and bizarre experiments, Ray's excitement, Venkmen's sleepy rascal and Winston's exasperated ness (I love when he says that the Mayan calendar going only to 2012 is just laziness if you ask him).

Play and controls - You play as a nameless rookie (male or female) and basically a guinea pig to try out all of Egon's new weapons which is a great excuse for you to get all the cool stuff.  You move with the numb chuck analog stick, A and B fires your weapons, C locks on and Z throws your trap.  The only frustration for me is that this is one of those games where the Wiimote must be pointed at the screen at all times as it controls your view and turning as well as your aim.  It can get tedious to point at the screen at all times even when just walking around and you can forget during crazy action sequences.  Fighting works pretty well though - you can blast some enemies and some you can wear down then catch in a containment beam and trap just like in the movie.  Once they are weakened you can smash the ghost around the room with Wii flicks based on on screen prompts and this part is really fun to do and makes you feel like a Ghostbuster (who you gonna call).  Then you drag them into the trap and they are sucked in.  Boss fights (with some truly cool looking bosses) are fairly simple but impressive.

Weapons and sounds - Of course you have your trusty proton pack and stream but you're the weapons specialist so it's not too long before you get an upgrade to that, a slime cannon, a stasis beam and shot and so on.  One of the cooler gadgets is the EKG scanner you can use to track ghosts - especially if they are hiding and the accompanying goggles let you see spectral objects like hidden doors, ghostly traps, ghost trails and special objects.  All the weapons make the sounds you'd expect especially the most familiar proton stream.  Again this contributes to the fun.

Story - The story plays much like a 3rd movie in the franchise (the outstanding voice work really helping) with a story line that ties back to the original movie.  You find yourself against old and new foes which is great (it wouldn't be Ghostbusters if you didn't get to blast the Stay Puffed Marshmallow Man) as well as in old and new locations.

I've seen complaints about the length of the game being short or that there are several and long cut scenes.  If you're a casual gamer though or just want more of that Ghostbuster goodness then this should make you happy and be a four star game.

Griffiths,"The third of the well-received ""Fatal Frame"" series carries on all the same gameplay as it's predecessors, but as the idea has proved to be such a good one, there's nothing wrong with that. Playing as a young female reporter called Rei - the most grown-up main character seen so far in the series - the player is once again armed with a ghost-busting camera and sent to explore a huge dilapidated Japanese mansion. And once again you will encounter vengeful phantoms that need to be dispatched via split-second timing of getting the best possible shots with the mysterious camera. This aspect is as fun as ever, as the best shots always come with the cost of putting yourself at most risk in order to take them (i.e. letting the ghost come as near as possible to attacking you). Also back are the many fleeting apparitions that you need to be lightning quick with your shutter-finger to snap on film. But it's all worth the effort, as these shots, along with your best ""attack"" photos score highly on a points system that lets you power up the capabilities of the camera, turning it into a more powerful ghost-buster for the later, harder phantoms...especially when it's sometimes not just one against one.

I had reservations as the game got underway, when I realised that all the spooky Japanese mansions were starting to get a bit repetitive, with the same old rotting cupboards and dusty kimonos at every corner, but the game has addressed this with a new slant on the gameplay, in that all the ghost hunting levels forms part of a recurring nightmare being experienced by main character. When she's not dreaming, she's awake and inhabiting her not-at-all spooky apartment. This splitting of playing time between dream trips to the forbidding mansion, and popping into the neat and tidy kitchen or stroking the cat, reminded me heavily of ""Silent Hill 4"", which used the same dual locations, and must have been an inspiration for this game. Cleverly, the game has Rei being up and about in her own apartment between both day and night times, and after the horrors of the dream adventures, even this neat and modern location begins to make you fell uneasy when walking around it at night. There are also two more playable characters in the game which adds variety, as they can go into areas that Rei cannot access. They also have certain unique skills, but much weaker ghost-busting cameras than Rei, so these stages can be tough. And once again those evil ghosts are no slouches, and getting the ""fatal frame"" shots can be pretty dicey, especially as these ghouls don't play fair and can vanish and teleport all over the place while you are swinging your camera around trying to keep them in view....you'll learn to hate those little girls with stakes and mallets!

Because of the fun to be had with the camera and the game in general, I'm prepared to once again forgive the same drawbacks that are still present as before - really clunky directional controls and the lamest ""run"" function ever witnessed - Rei runs like a little old lady hobbling after a bus. Despite starting off as a fairly easy game, the game keeps the reputation of the series up by occasionally throwing some really tough ghost battles at you, roundabout the halfway mark and onwards, so save often! Even so, the ghosts STILL don't live up to the creepy horrors of the first game (too many of the ghosts are smiling little girls, which doesn't scare me very much), but I think that this third installment actually has the most grown up theme; it's take on the rituals concerning death and the afterlife is handled very seriously and quite sensitively. It also has the most impressive ending movie of the series so far - effective and quite moving.

This game has very large areas to explore and a lot to do.  There are several huge worlds, each made up of several locations, like Crocovile Swamp and the Sunken Ruins.  Once you destroy all the Dark Gems in one of the big worlds, you can defeat a boss and then go to the next world.  There are many things to collect, too, like Light Gems for powering the Professor's gadgets (that can make you invincible or extra strong, for example) and dragon eggs for unlocking extras like concept art or two dragon characters to play as (which are pretty much identical to Spyro, though).  Also, whenever you destroy a Dark Gem, the area around it gets pretty again, which I always liked.  You also can get different breath attacks throughout the game, such as electric breath or ice breath, that are useful for different things.

This game also has five playable characters.  Normally, you play as Spyro, but there are special levels where you play as other characters, Sparx, Hunter, and two new characters, Blink and Sgt. Byrd.  With Sparx's levels, Sparx has to fly through somewhere, shooting enemies along the way while trying to survive until the end.  (His levels can be a bit difficult and frustrating.)  Hunter's levels are fun because you can take advantage of Hunter's speed and bow.  Blink's levels are underground (because he's a mole), and you must destroy Dark Gems.  (These levels can also be a bit frustrating due to Blink not always being the greatest jumper.)  Sgt. Byrd's levels are my favorite of the four extra characters, where you must fly through all the rings, shoot all the targets, etc. within the time limit.  These are a lot of fun.

The graphics in this game look nice, and the music is pleasant.  I think the design of the levels looks good, too, and I like much of the character design.  It can be a bit funny at times, too.

The game's graphics are excellent, and the fighters move at a believable speed.  The game will be even better after you master a particular fighter, and find a worthy opponent.  I can see a lot of enjoyment coming out of the two-player feature of this game.
On the negative side, some people might be disappointed with how quickly a fight can end.  Even if your fighter has full strength, if he suddenly gets caught in a submission hold, it's over.  The biggest problem is probably the complete lack of direction from the instruction manual.  You have to stop the fight to see a full list of your character's moves, and even then, there is no real information on what the move is - the game just shows you what buttons you can push to do a move, and not what that move may be.
A suggestion I would like to make for future versions of this game would be the inclusion of a training mode, where you can see every move your fighter can do while working with a ""dummy"" fighter.

Like the Mario Parties before it, Mario Party 3 creates exciting new ways to play graphic visual 3-D board games with your friends. With a variety of different maps to choose from, my friends and I almost never get tired of this game.

II's battle system is annoying and ponderous because ""even in 'regular' battles, it forces you to spend many turns Stocking just so that you can do decent damage to enemies."" This is actually a form of codespeak. What these people are really saying is ""I'm not very bright, and even after several hours of playing Ep. II, I somehow never realized how to use the battle system efficiently derp!""

Ep. II's battle system was designed around the concept: ""For every task, there is the perfect tool."" It puts a great deal of emphasis on each character's specific attack attributes. Each character's attacks have unique combination of traits, and it's important to use the right character against the right enemy. The traits are classified as either Physical or Ether, there are elementals (fire/ice/lighting/aura) and finally there are types (slash/pierce/hit). Sound complicated? Eh, a little more so than the average RPG. Not nearly as bad as something like Vagrant Story. All you have to do is use Analyze on any enemy you're unfamiliar with to see their weaknesses, and then use the Change command to bring in the character that has the proper attack traits, if they aren't already in your battle party. When you come across enemies with Physical/elemental weaknesses, there are Ethers which you can cast to add that element to a character's physical attack. If their weakness is ether/elemental, then just use the standard elemental Ether spells against them. This is all you need to do to make battles flow at nice, normal pace.

For some reason, the vast majority of Ep. II players seemed to never realize this. Instead, they saw their only option to be using the Stock command for nine (NINE!) turns in a row before beginning their attack. Even on wimpy garden variety wandering monsters! They took no heed of enemy weaknesses, e.g. using characters with physical/fire based attacks against enemies weak vs. ether/ice. RPG players used to have a reputation for being the more intelligent gamers. I wonder what happened...

A lot of Ep. I fans never bothered to play Ep. II because negative word of mouth spread so quickly amongst the fanbase as soon as the JP version was released. But now that Ep. III is out (and it's truly fantastic) a lot of them will finally play Ep. II soon. I hope they do better than the first rounders did.","Xenosaga Ep. II: Was sind Sie, Ein Dummkopf?",1155945600,2,,

-Very basic story, with bad writing
-it's more about equipment and looting then exploring, and fighting
-enemies have a lot of health, but are pretty dumb.

these all sound like bad things, but it plays like a MUCH MORE mmo element heavy borderlands, to the point where they're not even really the same type of game. the movement on foot, or in a vehicle is very fluid. and it plays like typical action RPG (combat wise)
Just think Halo with double jumps for the shooting, but like an action rpg, you spend a lot of time standing in one spot, just pressing the attack button.

But the Fun in this game comes from improving your character, just like in an action RPG, you find better gear, level up, learn skills, and work together to fight strong bosses.

Progression: Level cap 20,
You can reach it in well under 30 hours,
but after that, you can level up your abilities, weapons and gear,
once you hit 20, you can get ""light points"" on your rare gear.
Get enough light points, and you can even Break the level cap
(boost past level 20) but you can Not get past level 20 by gaining EXP, any boosts are based on equipped gear.

Conclusion
I really enjoyed this game, also it seems to be marketed as a Halo style game
It's more of An MMO/Action RPG/FPS. I wish they'd let you play offline (as I've been disconnected quite a few times in the past few days,
and have had to start mission over again)
But it's still provided me with a lot of fun. The AI has some major issues, and the social interaction is not done very well (or really at all, lol)
and the story, and mission variety could have been better. but even after even just four days and quite a few hours in and quite a few hours,
I feel I got my monies worth, and that's not something you can say about most games.

I tried the downloadable demo for Eternal Sonata and decided I liked what I saw and the fighting system, so I went ahead and got the game.

While the game itself is very beautiful and bright, with a satisfying and interesting real-time/turn based battle system that I won't go into detail about, the story is a little off putting to me. It has some 'dark' themes and the typical save-the-world type elements involved in a RPG, but the rest of it just seems like it was geared for a younger audience.

I have not finished the game at this point, so I won't comment on the actual plot, but the voice acting and some of the character's personalities irritate me for some reason. I might even add, this is the same reason why I probably never finished Final Fantasy 13. The characters just seemed too cliche, the things they say and do are kind of redundant sometimes, and I can't get into a game where the acting makes me roll my eyes half the time.

I don't think this is a bad game, its just that I had hoped for a darker and more mature RPG, and not one where almost every character is a little kid running away from home or some complaining brat who just seems to tag along. I mean seriously... you're out on a serious adventure to save the world, and you're babysitting some 8 year old kids!! They are battling with you, and adding their cutesy little quips and comments every now and then... just seems ridiculous to me.

If you can get over the 'youthfulness' of the game and the voice acting (heard putting on Japanese voices helps), then you probably would really enjoy this game. Like I said, I think this is a good game, great graphics, typical but interesting story, and fun battle system. The cliche-ness of the characters leaves less to be desired but maybe I am just being nit-picky. RPGs are suppose to have cliche characters right? Since they almost all do.

Playing a mushroom man called Pax the gamer is taken through about ten levels wherein Pax, who naturally has a bug's eye view of the world, tries to collect meteor fragments that are responsible for giving he and his fellow 'shrooms (among other animals) a sentience.  You can tell that the developers had fun creating this one, especially the bug's eye view of the world that Pax inhabits.  Nods to pop culture in the visuals abound (consider coming across a variety of old school soda pop caps that riff off established drinks like the orange ""Crash"" for orange Crush and such) and Pax explores a variety of terrains from the outdoor matchbox village of the mushroom men to the interior of a dilapidated shed to mole work catacombs to the rusting and disgusting camper/ trailer at game's end.  Along the way he collects a variety of common objects (string, rubber bands, toothpicks and such) that he uses to make a variety of weapons.  Pax's enemies are mutated animals and other, larger Mushroom men and the fighting is dispersed fairly well throughout the game so as not to ever feel overwhelming.

The game is linear and it lets you replay levels to collect all that you might have missed (and there's not actually that much to collect) and is rarely hard for an adult to navigate.

When I purchased my PS Vita this was on my list of games that I must have. Not only did it come with one of my favorite Metal Gear games, it included MGS3: Snake Eater.  I never got to play Snake Eater when it was originally released. Hailed as one of the best MGS games at the time, I had to play that one first.

I found both games to be a great amount of fun. I have beaten MGS2 so many times when I originally owned it; I was quick to run through it as I remembered where mostly everything is. It was great fun and brought back a lot of great memories.

MSG3: Snake Eater is a different beast all together, this game was awesome. I loved the camo system that rated how you are actually blending in with your current environment. I loved the story and of course the dialog between characters (Hideo Kojima loves him some cut scenes).

The only issues I have are with the controls. This isn't a game breaker but it does take some getting used to. I would constantly push the stick where I though Snake/Big Boss/Riden would go but they ended up going the opposite way. Not a huge deal but it took a bit to get used to.

4.0,False,"12 12, 2011",A3LW719EUK6L0V,B004Z4ZKL6,CKwon,"FIFA 12 is a great football game.  I hope that anyone reading this review is already an experienced FIFA player since my review will, in large part, be a comparison to previous versions.  Also, 99% of my game play is online so most of what I am talking about is the gameplay while playing online.

The best thing about FIFA12 is the new Tactical Defending engine.  In previous FIFAs, defending was all about holding on to the X button to tackle while holding on to the O button to get a teammate to come press the dribbler.  Sure, it didn't work all the time against really good players but it was good enough to shock and awe most of the competition.  The ""X"" tackle (standing tackle) worked too well.  It was really too easy to dispossess the ball.  In FIFA12, if you don't time your standing tackle, you'll get burned.  Because standing tackle is really hard to time right, often you'll be ""swinging and missing"", allowing the dribbler to go right around.  In FIFA12, defending is really about positioning and having the defender in the proper position.  (Containment).  I have read countless posts on online forums where people are really ticked off about the new defending mechanism because it really takes practice and getting used to but the gameplay is really more rewarding.  Being able to anticipate the offense's passing lane and then making interceptions is much more satisfying than just holding onto the ""X"" button.  By the way, the old way of defending is now called legacy defending and still can be used offline.

The other big gameplay change is the new collision physics engine.  I am not saying this is a good or a bad thing but it sure makes for interesting animation, especially in tight quarters.  Players are much more prone to getting knocked down and stumbling.  It can make for some frustrating moments.  For instance, I was running back on defense and slightly brushed against a teammate and caused both me and my teammate to stumble, which gave my opponent a clear path to the goal.  But this also is a matter of getting used to.  You just can't run around like a chicken with its head cut off.

Now, going to the online mode, there is a huge, huge change and I am not sure if it's a good thing.  You can no longer play ranked online matches in the old ""QUICK Ranked match"" or even in the online lobby.  They totally got rid of the whole ranked points system too.  The way it works is now, you have to play a ""season"" to play ranked matches.  You start out at Level 10 (10 being the lowest level).  You get maximum of 10 games and for each win you get 3 points and 1 for tie.  Once you get 16 points or more, they send you to the next level.  If you are below the relegation point level which is like 10, then they send you back down one level.  It's possible to get just enough points to stay at your level.  But that's not even the biggest change.  The biggest change is that you pick your team before hand before each match.  Only after have you selected your team and made all the starting lineup changes will the server match you up with another player with a similar star level team.  So if you like using the top tier teams, (Chelsea, Man City/United, Inter, Barca, Real, etc.)  That's all you will play against.  And you won't even know the actual team you are playing until the game starts.  If you like using 3 star teams, then you will be matched up against other 3 star teams and will never play against 4 or 5 stars teams.  In some ways, I like this because I liked using lesser teams from time to time in the past, only to have my opponents always pick Barca even though I was trying to use a MLS Team, which was unfair.  But the new system does restrict you in that the game has fixed certain things for you and you no longer even have the option of using a 2nd division team against a top division team.  Plus, since you are locked in with the team, you can't make adjustments.  Some people like using Real against Chelsea but Barca against Man U.  That flexibility is gone.  The one thing I do like is that because you pick your team AND the lineup beforehand, you don't have to wait for the other player to spend the whole 40 seconds tinkering with their lineup.

Note for unranked online matches, the old system is still in place.

4.0,False,"06 4, 2006",A310UDRCX415OS,B000E36ONK,David East,"MM is certainitly an improvment over recent installments to the series. AWL did some things right, but the town was monotinus and the spose selection was dreadful. But it was certaintly better than Save The Homeland, which was an attempt of innovation, but in my opinion, a failure. Then of course HM64 is the benchmark of the series, the one that set the bar for all HMs to come, and a mark that so far none have reached.

But MM is admirable. The spose selection is impressive, especially when taken into account there are technically 20 options, depending on your gender. The gender option obviously adds a new dimension to the game to incorporate more players, so bravo there. The rival idea is also nifty.

But I think that the graphical quality has gotten progressivly worse since 64. I still think that 64s graphics are better then all since it, not because of the techincallity of them, but because they were so fitting. Save the homelands were good, but I've never been a huge fan of cell shading. AWL and MM, however, are just inexcusably bad graphics. Yes they're cute and adorable, but is there really where the developers want the game to be? Probably so, but I hope not. Its too the point that the characters hardley even look like people, but their own style of cartoon. The purpose of the game is simulation, and I for one think that the graphics should be less cartooney and more realistic, in the sense that they should have, I don't know, distinguishable body shapes. I believe that needs re-phrasing, I don't necessarily think that it does need to be more realistic per se, just a slightly more...mature cartoon style. I think all the children playing the game can handle that, don't you?

If the developers want a rough, easy to follow guideline on how to make a great new harvest moon, here it is. Take Harvest Moon 64 as a template. Improve the graphics technically, no cell shading or super-cartoonizing. The town should be big enough to incorporate everything it needs. Seasons, crops, animals, all that nonsense, its hard to go too wrong on that. Festivals are great, but if your going to have them, have them make some sense and purpose. Make girls/guys who look like girls/guys, not a big ball with hair and a face and a tiny body attached to it. Bring back the heart meter. Cutscenes. Lots of them. Theyre fun and rewarding. The more spose options the better, as long as they're distincly different enough. You can kill off the sprites as far as im concerned, but whatever.

The important part of this game has, and always will be in my eyes, the wooing of a spouse and marrige. The interactions with other people in the game.

I was skeptical when it only allowed for the sideways wiimote 'steering wheel' style controls, but they actually work great!  Your car slides around the tracks so much anyway, accurate driving is not as important as sheer speed.

A big part of the game is the 'car-fu' aspect... battling the other drivers physically with your car.  You can do flips, back flips, jumps, 180 spins, 360 spins, side swipes, corkscrew jumps, etc.  lots of moves, and they add up as combos as you're hitting different vehicles.  This is a lot of fun when you're packed in tight during a close race.  It's almost disappointing when you're doing well and end up ahead of the pack, as there is no one to fight!

Successful attacks will not only gain you a physical lead, but also give you a bit of boost.  When your boost gauge is full, you can boost (duh), or you can swap some of the boost to repair your vehicle.  Since you can only boost when the bar is full, using boosts and doing repairs becomes much more of a strategical aspect than in most driving games that feature nitro.

There are also 'rivals' and 'alliances'.  Certain racers who will hunt you down, or specifically help you out or leave you alone.  If you attack neutral characters, they may become rivals, as well as if you hurt allies.  You can choose to abandon alliances before the race, or offer to form an alliance as well.

The graphics are very pretty and have the same bright, saturated look the film does.  The tracks have lots of loops, curves and jumps to keep them interesting.  Think F-Zero, but more forgiving.  You rarely need to lay into a curve to come out successfully, so you can just focus on speed and having fun.  It's still a challenge though, as the other racers have their own boosts and attacks.

There are loads of unlockable characters and tracks for added replay.  I was surprised how differently each driver felt.  They are rated by the typical 'speed', 'acceleration', 'handling', etc. of most driving games, but they actually represent a real difference.  This is similar to Mario Kart in that each driver really does feel unique.

Overall, an overlooked gem.  The recent PS2 port is said to have even more tracks and characters, so it might be worth a wait, but the Wii controls really shine with this racer.",F-Hero,1221523200,3,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii'},
4.0,True,"06 9, 2017",A6VG04A8TN0JE,B00ZQC73O8,kevin bg,"I view Horizon Zero Dawn as a huge step towards producing a quality open world game. While enjoyable at times the elder scrolls and fallout series have always possessed a certain crudeness. Combat was always somewhat clunky, with generally poor animations and the weight of your movements feeling lacking.
HZD however has created a world where you feel very much a part of it as you move through. The environment shifts around you, your attacks feel substantive, and a toll is taken on the world from your actions/battles. Occasionally when on the edges of accessible terrain things will get a bit spotty with traversing the landscape, but all in all its a great experience.
The second huge stride forward is making the main story somewhat compelling and feel like the primary reason your playing as oppose to getting distracted exclusively with side quests before getting bored and walking away.
The final notable thing I appreciated were how large scale battles with allies actually felt legitimately like they were providing a helping hand, which mixed with solid animations and large numbers of npc's made the group battles feel far realer and significant.
In terms of negative, I will say the difficulty is weird. I played on hard until the end personally at which point it felt like the numbers were too severely set against me, and that it was just tedious to fight enemies I'd gone through the motions of killing for so many hours when they were just damage sponges. I only dropped it down probably in the last 10% of the game however, and this is partially because I platinumed it, which involved far more playtime than just beating it through.
Though the ranged combat is stellar, the melee combat feels quite basic, and was a standout weakness in terms of gameplay quality.
A huge pet peeve in terms of discovering the lore of the world is that most of the audio logs are all clumped together, and that you slow walk when the focus is active to discover them. This results in an extreme slowdown of gameplay during certain portions, where you're slowly creeping around discovering the audio logs and then waiting for them to play out before activating the next. While I appreciate from a lore perspective it makes sense for the audio logs to be where they were, I do wish they had done something to make these sections less awful. If you don't care about the story or finding all the logs this shouldn't bother you too much but for me and those who were unfortunate enough to stop in to see what the game was all about during these sections, they were a slog.
Lastly, while the story was fairly compelling throughout(though you do have to suspend some serious disbelief to enjoy it), the end felt very cliche and similar to many other open world titles, with needing to rally people against a generic threat.

4.0,True,"06 7, 2012",A2LPJD19MGBNXJ,B002BRYHY0,Adrian Jenkins,"...although, as in many other cases, that is damning with faint praise. Resonance of Fate is a Tri-Ace offering, so if you know what that means, you know what to expect. If not, that's OK - what it means is that you generally have an interesting and original battle system, a compelling story concept, slow but (usually) methodical development, and a ton of grinding. In fact, this game's battle system is actually incredible, but the story development pays for it, as it is woeful. Also, grinding has been mostly cut back this time around (at least by Tri-Ace standards). If that's your cup of tea, you're in the right place. If not, well, look elsewhere.

I won't even bother explaining the story - your best bet is to watch the opening movies (BOTH of them - another appears after the title screen), and then wait until around chapter 14 (out of 16 chapters) to see what's going on. By then, you probably won't care.

THE GOOD:

BATTLE MECHANICS: I have to confess, it took me three separate tries and almost a year and a half before I finally got into this game, but when you get it, it's great. Basically, battles are as follows: you have machine guns and handguns. Machine guns do what is called ""scratch damage,"" which is temporary damage. Hand guns do permanent damage, and convert ""scratch damage"" into permanent damage as well. The (obvious) catch: machine guns do a ton more damage than hand guns, but scratch damage heals over time (sometimes very quickly).

[Author's Note: I realize it is absurd to think of a world where machine guns do essentially fake damage, but if realism is your thing, you might want to leave now. We have only scratched the surface of the absurdity.]

There are also throwing weapons, such as grenades, but the majority of the time, this is your set-up. Enemies also do damage to you, but always in the form of scratch damage. However, when your life bar is completely depleted, you lose gems known as ""bezels"". Lose all of your bezels, and all damage becomes permanent damage. The (not-so-obvious) catch: bezels are also the currency to fire off your so-called ""hero actions,"" which is the ticket to multiple attacks and massive damage, since you can ""charge"" your weapon without fear of reprisal. And of course, there is the ""tri-attack,"" which must be charged, also costs bezels, but allows all three members of your party to attack simultaneously.

Sounds confusing? Well, it is. Thankfully, there is a tutorial inside of the arena. Not so thankfully, the arena is outside the town, which means that if you get caught in an attack, you will probably have no clue what is going on. Even when you get to the tutorial, the explanations are often so vague that you will find yourself going online to see what they're really talking about (the ""smackdown"" attack, which is mostly useless, was hell on me). However, once you get it, it's a joy to behold. While I will stop short of saying that battle is strategic, it certainly requires thought, and you will die more than once (probably in the first chapter, no less). But Tri-Ace has never disappointed me with a battle system, and this is no exception. However, not unlike Star Ocean, it is a real pain to switch characters.

CUSTOMIZATION: This game has a ton of customization options. First (and definitely of lesser importance), you can dress your characters up in a wide variety of ways. You can dye their hair, give them glasses, give them a casual look or a work look, etc. Moreover, your choices will be reflected in the cutscenes. If I have one gripe, it's that these costumes are noting more than aesthetic - there are no changes to character parameters. So, e.g., although a pair of boots might say that it protects you from monsters, it doesn't.

More important is the customization of the gun. Again, the game does a poor job of explaining the system, but once you get it, you can have many customization options at your fingertips. In fact, this has an added bonus: different guns can customize in different ways, so you can actually get a lot of use out of early guns even when later guns appear. Of course, the actual customization is absurd. Why put one sight on your gun when you can have...10 sights? (I am not kidding, BTW - you can easily have 10 sights on your gun.) When affixing barrels to guns, you might actually hook them to...a handgrip? And why would you affix handgrips in multiple locations, anyway? It doesn't make a lick of sense, but if you can get over that, it's a ton of fun. Of course, some parts require rare elements which must be won (randomly) in battle, while others require many, MANY wins in the Arena.

If I have one gripe regarding curstomization, it's the lack of a ""try before you buy"" option. Sometimes, affixing a part to your gun is a confusing process, requiring perfect alignment of 2 or even three separate fixtures. However, you can't actually see your gun when you buy or create parts, so you will either go back and forth between shop and menu to determine the best fit, or else just guess at it, and hope it works.

OVERWORLD MECHANICS: A lot of people don't like the overworld in Resonance of Fate. I am not one of them. The idea is as follows: everyone lives on a giant tower, which requires energy for activation. In order to activate the tower, you place different ""hexes"" on the overworld, which will energize them. The world is completely made up of these hexes, and the hexes you use to activate the world have different shapes and sizes. If your hex doesn't fit on the world, you can't use it. Also, sometimes you will need colored hexes to activate cities (once again, absurdity rules. Are these cities completely inactive before you energize them? But then...why are there people living there?) I'm making this sound more confusing than it is - it's actually a pretty simple system, although there is one major confusion (more later). Sometimes when you activate a part of the overworld, you will get a treasure chest. This can range from a first aid item (easily the most useless thing in the game - if you are using first aid items, you're in trouble), to special grenades or rounds for your gun (very useful) to Bezel shards (obviously the most useful of all).

There are also objects called ""terminals"" in the overworld. By using colored hexes, you can unlock these, and later, activate them. This is actually confusing, though - sometimes you'll try to place a colored hex, only to be told that it's impossible. That's because you need to create a colored energy station. I can't tell you how long that took me to figure out. However, once you get it, you can link terminals together to produce devastating effects. For example, I was able to link terminals to the Arena, and would get 3x experience, 6x item drop rate, and 4x rare item drop rate in every battle I fought!

THE BAD:

STORY: As I mentioned before, Tri-Ace is known for glacial development in story, although the concepts are often good. Here, they fail on both sides. I thought the concept looked promising after the opening movies (particularly the second one). A church that rules the world, but hides a secret that could destroy it? Sounds like a winner to me. Unfortunately, that's not exactly how things go. In fact, I am at the last boss in the game (only because I am doing a lot of grinding for the plat), and I still can't really tell you the main focus here. And a major part of that problem is that the developers do NOTHING to explain this story. The game itself consists of 16 chapters + 1 prologue. These chapters consist of some of the most mundane tasks imaginable. You might bring a rock to a cardinal. You might find a statue in a forest. You might take another statue into another forest. Even as late as chapter 13(!), you are doing silly things (a Christmas party, in which you shoot kids with presents as they run up to you and stun you). It's just so...stupid. Thankfully, you probably won't care because of the battle system (while the tasks are idiotic, the bosses keeping you from these tasks are anything but, and often provide incredible challenge), but come on. We can do better.

RANDOM ENCOUNTERS: I love the battle system, but it has one flaw - it takes time. That's fine when I'm in a dungeon - I'm meeting new enemies and developing ways to deal with them. But in the overworld? It gets old. Fast. Often, you'll find yourself fighting the same enemies you fought in the initial chapters (the ""Closed Road"" hexes are a different story, as the enemies actually level up sensibly). Sometimes, you can end a battle fast by attacking the leader. However, often, you'll have to defeat every enemy on the screen. Remember that after almost every tun, each enemy will get to attack you. Often, they have separate animations, which really makes battle drag.

So anyway, it's basically a Tri-Ace game. You've got your great battle system. You've got your crazy difficulty spikes. You've got your story that goes nowhere for hours (actually, this is worse than usual). It really depends on what you want from a game.

It actually pains me to give it 3 stars instead of 5. I've been a Fire Emblem fan since FE6 (the first FE for us outside of Japan).

There's way too much fan service for me to fully enjoy the game. Not to mention, grinding. So much grinding. Fire Emblem didn't used to include these things (or at least not heavily).

For fan service, there's coupling. I was never interested in lovey-dovey stuff. Though it is pretty cool that you recruit new characters by marrying couples, it really doesn't add much to the story. In fact, the dialogues from the characters interacting from the support feature are rather dull. On past Fire Emblem games, I used to love the interaction. The characters had richer personalities. On this game, the reason their personalities aren't as rich is because the player has the choice of marrying any man to any woman. This creates a more generic feel to them. It sure adds more replay value, but affects the feel of the story in a bad way.

Speaking of dialogue, there's a lot of cussing this time. I'm actually very surprised since this is a Nintendo series. Not only does it bother me but it also makes me miss the creativity used in the past games. The past games were very creative in the dialogues to make the characters not sound cheesy when in despair or in anger. Very clever wording was used instead of the typical, ""Damn it all to hell!"" kind of dialogue. Now it's all the typical kind of language you see everywhere in other games and movies. Quality went real down on writing style. Real down.

Then we have grinding. Wow. Lots and lots of grinding. I'm down to 90-something hours and I feel as though I'm not even halfway in the game. Heck, I don't even remember in what part of the story I'm in. I'm spending most of my time grinding and building character stats and relations to recruit more characters that in turn make do more of the same thing all over again. In past games, recruiting was much more simpler. Sure, I could skip doing all of this, but then I wouldn't be ""enjoying"" all the features of the game.

The game is ridiculously hard. FE has always been an insanely hard game (especially because of permanent deaths) but now it's even worse. It's cool that you can turn perma-deaths off but veterans like myself like to turn it on. However, I'm actually regretting it. I had to pay for DLC to get a map that helps gain EXP very, very easily. But even with this map, the game just keeps getting way too hard after each map in the story (did they make this on purpose so we'd pay extra?). Enemy units love to concentrate on either Chrom or the weakest character that you have at the moment. Also, when enemy units appear out of nowhere, you don't have a turn to organize your units to counter attack accordingly. Because once they pop up, they attack right away. This wasn't the case in past FE games.

Anyway, this whole review seems like I'm whining, but the game is not that bad. It's just pretty disappointing. I really loved the Fire Emblem series for what it was. However, I guess all these changes had to happen in order for the series to survive. Fire Emblem Awakening was going to be the last game in the series, but since the sales went off the charts because of all the fan service, the series will keep on going. If fan service is the only way to keep it alive, then so be it. I still want FE to live.

Pros:
1. Xb1X gives every game regardless of age a very huge increase in preformace.
It also completely removes frametearing on older games that had it.
2. Xb1X 4K bluray playback looks beautiful, see the pictures. I don't use hdr so the bug everyone using hdr doesn't effect me. I watch movies in perfect quality.
3. Native 4K gaming seriously ripped me out of my chair! The level of detail is unreal. Tombraider in native 4K is simply GLORIOUS!
4. Xb1X is beyond whisper quiet! This thing is Prius silent! It also stays relatively warm instead of hot.
5. The Scorpio edition packaging is super HIGH-END ! I felt like I was unwrapping a $500 console.

Cons:
1. Serious lack of 1st party games to play in native 4K.
2. Not ""the best resolution, best framerates, no compromise."" Experience I was exited for.
3. Games still crash when running HEAVILY demanding games. For Example, Wwe 2k17 still crashes when in creation mode for long periods of time.
4. Theres only 1TB of storage. Meanwhile, 4K assets are over 90GB! My Xb1S has 2TB..so not sure what happen there on the X.
5. Standard Xbox One X packaging is very cheap and entry-level. Dispite paying the same $500,You are given a marginally less premium unboxing experience.

Overall, this console is fantastic at playing games. And as an owner and lover of ps4 pro and switch, the X does beat the both in image quality on a noticable level. That said, I am still excited to play Spiderman on the pro..so this console changes nothing for me in that respect. If you buy the X make sure its for the RIGHT reasons. I personally like the pc level visuals,and truly enjoy 4K movies. While pc is always more powerful, remember that it also costs alot more to run games in native 4K..even at 30fps.

4.0,False,"11 28, 2007",A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B00002SUR7,blackaciddevil,"Critical Depth came about in a time when Sony's 989 Studios took the Twisted Metal & Jet Moto licenses back from Developer Singletrac and decided to make their own versions of those games. I, like many others, was a huge Singletrac supporter back in the day. Their Twisted Metal & Jet Moto games were simply fun, addictive and challenging. Yet, when they created new games for GT Interactive in the vein of their old licenses, that's when I think Singletrac did some of their best work. That's not to say that any of their older properties weren't as good...Twisted Metal 1&2 and Jet Moto 1&2 are classics. It's just they came up with new ideas for these games that actually worked and I, personally, would've loved to see sequels to these games. Sadly, though, we'll never get that chance.

One such case is Critical Depth. Think of it as a Twisted Metal but with an underwater theme. There's more to this one, though, as the story goes like this...Douglas McKragen(an undersea explorer)comes up missing when he discovers fives alien-pods underwater. Twelve different factions enter the sea to find out more about these pods and set a course to uncover this mystery. The games' cast include the nefarious Dr. A. Pocalypse captaining the Armageddon (which can trap subs with a grappling hook); the revolutionary organization the VLO with The Anarchy (which drops spiky metal balls); several men-in-black types from the CIA with The Manta (which fires a deadly electromagnetic ray); the Soviet Die-Hards and The Stalingrad (a slow but strong ramming ship); the Indiana Jones-like Professor Armstrong and The Archimedes (which is a rapid-firing Jules Verne-type sub); Greenpeace wanna-bes Team Earth Hope and the Mean Peace (which shoots a dolphin-shaped torpedo); ex-children's show host Captain Cutlass with the Sea Dog (yep, it blasts cannon balls); the evil Mordrid Corporation and the Bottom Liner (which steals weapons); Jack ""Lockjaw"" Keon and The Lockjaw (a shark-like sub with a bite); Deadhead Joe Skullion and the Death Sled (which shoots trippy-colored discs that stun); the mystical Order of Nishroch and the Ohm (which casts energy blasts); and The French Oceanographers and the La Griffe (which has crushing mechanical arms). This cast is just as memorable as those in Twisted Metal. It has three modes of play...The Story mode where you(and a friend, if you like) plays through eleven levels to find out your faction's involvement in it all, The Battle mode which has you being the first to capture all the pods in the level, and the Deathmatch mode which is, basically, where you fight against a friend or the game itself in split-screen. Instead of annihilating your enemies as in Twisted Metal, your objective in this game is to find the orbs in each level and head for the escape gateway. But, trust me, you'll have your work cut out for you trying to. Another difference between this game and Twisted Metal is that Twisted Metal is blisteringly fast while Critical Depth is a more slow and plodding game. Make no mistake, it is definitely better for that reason. Besides, it has to be slow to give the illusion you're underwater, anyhow.

Now, on to my gripes about the game of which there is only one...the graphics. Compared to all the other games Singletrac made up to this point, this game looks pretty rough, grainy and washed out. Yet, that point is not so much a big deal. It's the gameplay that counts, right??? Singletrac's next game, Rogue Trip Vacation 2012, more than made up for all that in the graphics department.

Game play is pretty much identical.  The hair is finer, and more detailed, the water scenes seemed a bit better, but all in all, not having played them next to each other for direct comparison, I really didn't notice anything that jumped out at me otherwise.

But past the comparisons, it's still a fun game to play.  I like the paths for advancement, and weapon upgrades.  It's nice to get to decide where you want to focus your abilities, since I know some people prefer guns, others prefer the bow, so you can pick what you want to improve first.

4.0,True,"01 27, 2010",A2E2DIEJNGN688,B001EKTF60,ReToM7,"Okay, so I will start out by giving you a little background here. I am a gold member of Xbox Live previous to purchasing this package. My subscription was running out early 2010 and I needed to renew. I got an email from Microsoft (M$) regarding an automatic renewal using the credit card I have on file with them. I like to buy the points to purchase DLC (downloadable content to those who don't know all of these acronyms yet). I am not a fan of auto-renew, not because of the ease, but because M$ is not the best deal in town for their own service.

Generally, you can find 12-Month subscription cards for less than the $49.99 M$ will charge you. In fact, Amazon and Walmart (am I allowed to say that?) had a price war recently where the 12-Month card went all the way down to $30! So, I figured if I was going to spend that kind of money, what else can I get?

I found this package and figured it was time to add to my xbox toys. I had a headset already, as well as PGR 4 (Project Gotham Racing 4, but the 12-month card and the text pad were new to the collection. So, I purchased the bundle. Overall, if you don't have any of the stuff in the package, it's a great thing to have. I am going to break it down piece by piece for future buyers:

-12-Month Subscription - Xbox Live is great. I can't say enough about it. The only negative is the yearly price. Others do not charge to use their system to play games online. M$ does. I feel it's worth it still, but I have hopes that one day it will be closer to that $30 mark direct from M$. This is why the package did not get a 5-star rating.

-Headset - This is the same headset you get with every console. It's your basic headset but it does the job. It's certainly not a Turtle Beach headset, but it's good!

-Text Pad - If you have friends on xbox live, this is well worth it if you pass messages back and forth. I prefer this over voice messages. The text pad is great and allows you to type and use symbols quickly. Also, it's light and does not interfere with using the controller unless you hold it in the middle somehow. It's backlit too for those who game in the dark. Big fan!

-PGR 4 - I would read a separate review for it, but for the price you get it for here, it is well worth it. PGR is one of my favorite series. It includes high end sports car manufacturers as well as motorcycles this time around. It also has a more arcade race feeling versus a simulator, which makes it more fun for those who like to drift and button mash their way to the finish line.

The action in the game pretty much starts right off the bat, and at first it was extremely confusing from the controls and hard to get used to, and the heated firefights were frustrating because of them. Switching guns in a battle is quite a challenge, same with reloading.

Horseriding is fun, but about 5 spur-kicks and your horse is close to dying. And there is a lot of animal killing in this game, which isn't exactly cool in my books. You can kill horses, dogs, wolves, buffalo, deer, birds, anything you encounter.

My personal favorite is Electro because I've made some pretty sweet songs on that one. But all the clubs are good so this game suits any music fan.

An only downside is that you can't make music videos for your songs like you can in other music games. You can only use the video already on there. But anyway, it's still a great music-makin' experience.

My television and consoles are all on a black steel wire shelves.  When set on its side, the PS2 was on unsteady ground on my shelves.  Then I saw that this stand was available.  I decided to do some comparative shopping, but there was really no contest.
There are several stands available for the PS2, both horizontal and vertical.  I haven't the faintest idea what the point is to the horizontal one, it neither adds to the visual appeal of the system nor the stability.  I could be mistaken, but I don't think there is a danger of knocking the PS2 over while it's lying horizontally.  The other vertical stands were all black and very cheap looking.
Installation is very simple.  You just take it out of the box and slide the PS2 in the groove with the notched section in the back.  The front of the stand should be flush with the inset part of the PS2's ""bottom"" side.  After that, turn the Playstation logo on the drive tray a quarter turn clockwise and she's ready to go.

The characters are somewhat special and the music at its best is very good. Some battle music (and battles themselves) get very repetitive after a while with the same old same old, especially if you're in an area for too long. But it's an RPG. That might be a bit expected.

The most priceless part about this game is probably the dialogue. It's amazing. I am currently watching The Mother Marathon (May 18th) and wish that they would just slow down a bit when it comes to some text so we can read it all.

But I've played this game before so I already know some of it.
What else? There are four main characters, Ness, your average, silent protagonist from Onett, the keen magician in training, Paula from Twoson, the great mechanic and Bottle Rocket Launcher (those things rock), Jeff from Winters and last but certainly not least, Poo the Prince from (Dallom?) in the far east, who eventually weilds some killer ninja star magic.

Another huuuuge highlight in the game is its quirkiness. There are jokes here and there, some hideous characters (Piggy anyone?) and just all around weird things occurring all too often.

I really can't say enough about it. But I think I'm in the minority when I say that when things get hard, they get hard. And playing through this game while interesting is a bit long and I don't think it has THAT much replay value. That's probably why the score isn't perfect like everyone else's.

It's not without its faults, but this game from '95 is a gem if I ever knew one.

You have walkways that lead up on celings, and by shooting ""gravity flippers"" you can also change which direction is down.  Portals are everywhere, which let you walk into another room, or another part of the ship.  The levels range up to enormous sizes and the designers have put the new capabilities to good use.

Prey is probably the first (and likely only) Cherokee Indian inspired outer space first person shooter.  The graphics look great, it's fast paced, and, well, what's wrong with it?

Prey reminds me an awful lot of an older 3DRealms game, ""Rise of the Triad.""  That game featured huge levels and these trampoline/jumper spots that would launch your character all over the place.  It was a lot of fun at first, until you realized that despite all the jumping it was just shooting the futuristic Nazis over and over.  The same with Prey, every time you press a button you know three or four Hunters will come out a bunch of portals at you.

The things I'd really liked about recent shooters like FarCry was the variety.  That game took place in settings everywhere from jungle islands to ancient ruins to industrial complexes.  Prey takaes place entirely in the sort of bio-mechanical/industrial environment science fiction has too much of.  The enemies aren't particularly bright, and the combat is several steps backward.

The graphics are excellent and framerate solid, even when hitting huge air and getting the zoom-out effect where you see almost the entire map. That is one of the most exhilerating moments while playing.

The students are defined in 1 of 4 levels, basically mapping to the 3 face buttons and both L1/R1 I believe depending on your boost level and then combining that with some direction on your analog stick. This results in quite a few combination *technically*, but actually being fast enough or coordinated enough to pull of a face-button and 1 of 8 directions differently each time is a lot tricker than you think, especially since pre-loading your jump (pushing down then flicking up right as you crest a jump to throw yourself into the air) already positions your hands and fingers in a certain feel - coming out of a preload and immediately into the opposite motion, like down and triangle is pretty tricky.

I found myself pulling off the *same* stunts per-level over and over again (which give you less and less boost as you keep repeating stunts) just because it was the most natural feel to me when I frantically tried to pull something off before hitting the ground.

The game is fairly forgiving, I readily lost some races and readily won others... I couldn't detect any rediculous ""rubber banding"" that is a stable in the Need for Speed series and some other racers, it was a very natural feel of either ""I'm loosing"", ""I'm catching up"" or ""I'm winning""... and in some cases ""I'm destroying them!"".

4.0,True,"09 4, 2013",A1D496JVVQFHRR,B002BRYIJY,Requiem,"I struggle to give this game an accurate overall rating, because it's very difficult.  The story is the best I have ever experienced in Video games, bar none.  Better than any Final Fantasy, even better than my old personal favorite, Silent Hill 2.  I will not spoil anything, but I simply can not give the story enough praise!  Whats even worse is it sneaks up on you, really hitting you with the true, full story upon New Game + (which starts you halfway through the game, with all your old weapons, items, etc).  It is more than worth the second playthrough, just for the story alone.

The audio is also among the best I have ever heard.  Cavia put a LOT of work into this game, and it really shows.  My favorite song is Cold Steel Coffin, an epic opera used as a near-ghost-town's music.

The graphics are about average, maybe slightly below.  That being said, they aren't distracting.  They aren't so bad as to ruin your immersion.  They are fine, just not breathtaking.

The gameplay is fun, but very repetitive.  Cavia (the developers of this game) produced Drakengard and Drakengard 2 (and this game is actually based on one of the endings of Drakengard, though you don't need to play Drakengard to enjoy this game).  If you've played either of those games, you will know what you are getting yourself into, as far as gameplay goes.  It's a little different, but not all that much.  Swords and Spells.  No dragon riding this time, however.

I've heard people complain about the controls in this game. I can honestly say, I don't know what they are talking about.  The controls handled just fine for me, though I will openly admit that there were a few moments throughout the game when the camera was an enemy.  It's mostly ok, but there are a handful of moments where you honestly don't know if you are going to live or die, because you can't see.

And that's why I struggle.  The story and music are absolutely amazing, and if you are looking for a good story, look absolutely no further.  But the combat, while fun for me, is admittedly repetitive.  Rolling, blocking, sword swinging, and spell casting ad nauseum.
If you are just looking for a fun hack and slash, this game would get around 3-4 stars.  But if you're into story and audio, giving it a 5 out of 5 is slandering it.

Co-starring in this game and also playable is Nick Fury, but his trademark cigar-in-mouth has been removed from the home console port as a means of ""censorship"".This is one of numerous differences between the arcade and the Genesis version, but many fans seem most disappointed by this particular change.

The game is a side-scroller beat 'em up with the added flavor of allowing the Punisher to draw his gun and open fire during certain parts of the game. Those parts are infinitely satisfying, and the gunfire sound effect is quite good on the Genesis. What also sets this game apart is that there is no shortage whatsoever of weapons for the Punisher to use in the form of baseball bats, axes, swords, flame-throwers, lead pipes, ninja stars, knives, bar stools, and oil drums. In short, when Punisher isn't shooting up his enemies, he can resort to other weapons or standard fighting. This gives the player a tremendous amount of freedom in deciding how to approach enemies.

The bosses that standout the most are BoneBreaker (the half-human/half-tank), BushWhacker (has a gun for an arm), and the final boss, The Kingpin. Although I think this is a pretty cool line-up, I can't help but compare how pitiful the Genesis version of BoneBreaker looks compared to the arcade version. The assortment of enemies are generic thug-types, female ninjas that look really awful, and terminator-style robots. I should note that the female ninjas in the arcade wear skin-revealing clothes and are distinctly female, but in the Genesis version they wear more a more conservative outfit. The blood is also gone, and so are the martial arts enemies.

The level design, which directly resembles the arcade, is quite good. The Punisher or/and Nick Fury will fight in mob houses, on the street, on a moving bus, at a waterfront and warehouse, in the woods, the sewer, on a moving train, and in The Kingpin's headquarters. No levels were added, and some might feel that the game is too short. The in-game music barely resembles the arcade's, and doesn't sound very good. The challenge is fair on Normal and Hard, but only Expert difficulty reveals the ending to the game. I consider myself pretty good at beat 'em up type games, and I was able to finish the game on Normal my 2nd time playing.

Now where this game really has problems is with the control. The Punisher (or Fury) is horrifically sluggish on the controls and the movement. It feels as though Punisher is being severely weighed down with each movement, and it seems lousy that so many of the enemies move so much faster. The Punisher's jump is stiff and painfully difficult to control. All the smooth movements and speed of the arcade are sadly nowhere to be found. Even the Punisher's roll is slow and awkward. When I play this game I find myself desperately wishing that the control, speed, and movement were more on par with ""Streets of Rage 2"".

Again, I really wanted to like this game. I grew up playing the Sega Genesis and took great pride in my system getting quality games that Super Nintendo did not. Having a port of the awesome Punisher arcade to play was a huge plus for Genesis fans, but unfortunately, it is poorly executed, and a Super Nintendo port would have blown it out of the water. Shoddy music and poor controls prevent this from being a great installment in the Sega Genesis library, but it's still mild fun for beat 'em up enthusiasts, old-school arcade rats, and Punisher fans.

4.0,False,"11 16, 2016",A2WB7LZ595CR50,B01EZA0DEI,J,"I'm in the minority in that I buy FPS games like Call of Duty exclusively for the single player campaigns. I simply prefer gaming alone. I'm not introverted or antisocial, just an old school gamer who grew up playing that way and still prefer it.  In that regard, I found COD IW to be better than Battlefield 1. First, if you're a single player, BF1's campaign, while beautiful, was painfully short.  I completed the entire campaign in an evening. Infinite Warfare's campaign was perfect. Not too short and not too long. It took about two days of off and on playing to complete. Both games have excellent graphics engines with lush visuals and great effects.  The enemy AI in IW is also pretty good.  Yes, there are moments when the enemies are on a loop and you're expected to stick to the script, but most of the time, the AI is pretty good.  The campaign has the perfect balance of environments as you'all find yourself battling on the ground, in space craft, on earth, in outer space, on other planets, aboard huge space destroyers, in asteroid clusters and several other interesting landscapes. He campaign is laid out in a manner that allows the freedom of mixing it up if you tire of a particular battle style. For instance, if you're tired of space battles, you can choose ground assaults instead. You ultimately have to complete everything but it allows a break if certain battle types become too repetitive.  Is IW like Black Ops 3?  At times, yes. It's obvious they re-skinned a lot of the content from BO3 and ported it over. While I can understand some people being upset at that, it doesn't bother me at all. They also pull it off just well enough to avoid being wholly derivative.  I really enjoyed the IW campaign.

The Modern Warfare campaign is fun as well.  The remastered content looks great. Modern Warfare is a classic that stands up to the test of time very well.  It also feels good to get back to good, old-fashioned, non-laser shooting, boots to the ground combat.  It was a perfect idea to bundle the two together.  The only mild downside is that the AI shows its age in MW. Squad members frequently get in the way during firefights, especially when you're trying to seek cover.  They can also be pretty darn useless at times, literally standing by at the ready and watching as an enemy turns your character into Swiss cheese. Another thing I didn't miss all these years is cheap AI.  the AI in Infinite's campaign really shows how far they've progressed since MW. It is extremely annoying for the game to ratchet up difficulty by getting increasingly cheaper as it progresses.  Enemies spawn like cockroaches and lob nonstop grenades.  There is always something or someone in your way, particularly when you need to move fast to cover.  Enemies on later levels shake direct head shots off as if you threw a pebble at them.  Bullets magically appear from nowhere, defying all laws of physics.  Some grenades explode barely a second after the indicator goes off.  It's fun in a nostalgic way but definitely makes you appreciate how the current COD enemies actually use tactics to make the game more difficult instead of cheap cheats.  The compass style guidance system is more convoluted and confusing as well.  Despite these minor flaws, MW is still a blast to play in the campaign.

Infinite Warfare Lagacy is fun but not without issues.  My biggest issue is the frame rate. It can be atrocious at times. I have all the latest updates but I still frequently get skipping frames even during cut scenes.  Another issue is the installation time. It took over three hours for both games to install. That is not a typo or hyperbolic statement.  It really took in excess of three hours for both games to install, from 9pm to well past midnight.

That leaves me to comment on multiplayer.  While I am no fan of it, I did try it in IW and yes, it does stink. When (and I do mean when) I'm even able to get connected, it's bland and boring. It just seems too cartoonish and unrealistic.  It's not gritty like the old black ops multiplayer where it felt truly immersive and suspenseful.  It's just a bunch of insanely ranked up COD users hopping around a Dr. Suess looking world and killingnyou every two seconds.  It doesn't hold a candle to BF1 multiplayer, which is truly fun, even for hose of us without super fast finger twitch muscles and endless hours every day to dedicate to mastering the game.  I wasn't able to play multiplayer in Modern Warfare because it just kept saying it was unable to establish a secure connection.  I tried during the morning, afternoon, late night, weekdays, weekends... nothing worked.  I gave up because I don't play multiplayer anyhow and it wasn't worth the aggravation to keep trying.  If you're on the fence between this and BF1 for multiplayer, definitely buy BF1. If you're on the fence between the two games regarding campaigns, IW is he clear winner.  My rating is for the campaign only. If forced to rate multiplayer, I'd probably go 2 stars.","Both campaigns are sweet but yes, multiplayer does stink",1479254400,,"{'Edition:': ' Legacy', 'Platform:': ' Xbox One'}",

4.0,False,"01 3, 2012",ALG6LEG2J3B94,B003KZJB2U,Amazon Customer,"For $20 or less, ""NBA Jam"" for the Wii is a great buy, but not as fun as ""NBA Hang Time"" (1997, N64).  There's no create-a-player or hotspots in ""Jam"" (which I'll get to later), and my biggest pet peeve is how the game handles shoves.

There are no injuries in ""Jam,"" which defeats the purpose of halftime substitutions and limits the use of a shove.  You shove only to disrupt the action or get a cheesy steal, and you absolutely cannot use shove if the CPU/player is in any frame of a shooting or dunk animation, which differs from previous versions of the ""Jam"" line.  ""Jam"" also incorporates the spin/crossover moves which were issued forth with ""Hang Time,"" and those moves let you avoid a shove entirely.  In other words, playing against the AI at the highest difficult level is a real challenge.  It's a lot more fun to play against three humans after you get all the unlockables.

The game offers fun arcade two-on-two action, four player support, and extra modes like a game of 21 in which four players can play against each other simultaneously (a great addition).  Unfortunately, you can't best opponents internationally, as there's no Online play.  If you can't get a group of friends together then the replay value of Jam will quickly fade.  There are a ton of unlockables to get you going--and the game tells you how to get most of them if you need help--but the extra modes generally fall short once the unlocking is done.

The main mode, ""Classic Campaign,"" lets you pick a team and play through a 36-team journey.  Every time you get to the end of one of the six-team lines, you have to challenge a secret team, which, if you beat, you will unlock.  This mode is probably the most fun mode because every six games you will unlock a few things.

Next up is ""Remix Tour,"" which introduces several modes starting with a 2v2 power-ups mode.  However, the power-ups are predictable--they only show up near center court in two designated spots--and not only that, but the effects are hard to discern at first unless the announcer barks the name of the power-up for you.  The end result is the CPU will grab the power-ups before you can even see them (due to the locked cam), and even if you do get one they don't last long enough for you to impact the game.  Filler, in my opinion.

""Smash"" does a better job in the fun department, as it's a mode in which your goal is to damage the opponent's backboard.  Instant classic.  The best way to attack, and the only way to get the final blow, is to either dunk or alley-oop on the backboard (by the way, you can break the glass of the backboard with a dunk during regular games, which is a nice retro-easter egg).  However, it's not as much fun to play the AI in this mode because there's no game clock.  Much more fun to play with/against friends.

""Elimination"" and ""21"" are both best to play against friends as well, perhaps the most fun to play with friends, but ""21"" is fun to play against the CPU as well since you get to set the four opponents.  Ever want to have a halfcourt battle with Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Larry Bird, and Chris Paul?  It's every man for himself in these two modes, and a nice change of pace.

""Boss Battles,"" the final mode of ""Jam,"" can only be unlocked through the four ""Remix"" modes above, which gives you the incentive to play through the mostly boring modes.  The battles are just that, difficult one-v-one games against NBA legends.  Hands down the most challenging mode of the game.

I recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wii-Classic-Controller-Pro-White/dp/B0037US4IA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wii Classic Controller Pro - White</a>&nbsp;to play the game, but another pet peeve I had was you can't change the controller configuration (what button does what).  The way the Classic Controller is setup differs from how you use the Wii-Mote (the B button), which is annoying because the on-screen directions assume you are using the Wii-Mote.  You're even forced to use the Wii-Mote to get through ""Jam Camp,"" an obnoxious tutorial for new players which unlocks ""Big Head"" mode.  Another annoyance is how turbo is used by pushing the ""L"" button rather than the ""R"" button.  Just doesn't make sense for the Classic Controller.

While the game lacks the configuration a bug-filled ""NBA 2K"" game might have, ""Jam"" gets you the action and without needing to worry about your Wii console freezing up (2K games are lousy, just a warning--Jam is by EA).  The modes are hit or miss if you can't find someone to play with other than the AI, but the unlockables will keep you occupied for a long time.

After being on backorder from Amazon since June, my CoolerMaster (CM) Storm Quickfire Rapid (QFR) Stealth tenkeyless (TKL) keyboard  with Cherry MX green switches finally arrived. Currently, it is difficult to find TKL keyboards with Cherry green switches; therefore, because of the uniqueness of this keyboard, I thought it would be helpful to post a brief review. The price for this keyboard is $119.99 not including shipping; $105.91 for Amazon Prime. The same keyboard with Cherry blue switches is $94.99 or $81.53 for Amazon Prime. There are no pics in this review; please see the CM website for images of the product.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CM-Storm-QuickFire-Stealth-Compact-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard-with-CHERRY-MX-GREEN-Switches-and-Covert-Keycaps/dp/B00C2MBG4I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CM Storm QuickFire Stealth - Compact Mechanical Gaming Keyboard with CHERRY MX GREEN Switches and Covert Keycaps</a>

The main reason I bought this keyboard was for the green switches. Like Cherry blues, green switches have both tactile and auditory feedback when actuated -- you can feel a slight ""bump"" and hear a click. However, blues have an actuation force of 50 grams (actually 50 cN), whereas greens have an actuation force of 80 grams (80 cN). This puts the green switch into the range of the IBM buckling spring, which has an actuation range of 60-80 cN; however, because the actuation mechanism and force-time curve of the buckling spring is completely different from these processes in a Cherry green switch, using a keyboard with Cherry greens will not replicate the experience of typing on an IBM Model M keyboard. Nevertheless, there will be a noticeable difference between typing with blues versus greens; the greens will require harder key presses, making it more difficult to register a keystroke accidentally.

PACKAGING

The outer box was smaller than I had expected, and upon shaking it, I could feel the inner box sliding back and forth. When I opened the outer box, I found that the inner box was only partially surrounded by a few small airbags, and some of them were deflated. This poor packaging allowed the inner box to slip to and fro within the outer box. Usually, anything I have received from Amazon has been very well packed. This was an exception.

The inner Cooler Master box was a fairly standard container for a TKL keyboard, but with a cheaper feel and with more illustrations and branding than the box that housed my Filco MJ2 Ninja TKL keyboard. Inside the inner box, I found the keyboard wrapped in thin white foam, a small pamphlet manual, USB to PS/2 adapter, USB cable, and a bag containing two CoolerMaster-branded modifier keycaps along with a set of red keycaps with arrowheads on top and WASD on the front. I was a bit disappointed that CM did not include a clear plastic keyboard cover like the one that came with my Filco, but I would probably not use it anyway.

KEYBOARD CHARACTERISTICS

The keyboard is essentially identical in size and shape to the Filco MJ2 Ninja TKL, except that the corners of the CM case are slightly more rounded. The case has a rubberized texture that gives it a matte black appearance and a velvet-like feel. I assume, but I do not know, that the texture is a coating rather than being integral to the case material. I like the matte appearance, but I would prefer to know that this was an intrinsic property of the case rather than being a coating of some kind that might wear off with time.

Lifting the board out of the box, I appreciated a decent heft, due in part to the steel backplate. According to my balance, the keyboard weighs 907 grams without its USB cable and 953 grams with the cable (weight reported on the CM website is 940 grams), a bit lighter than the 980 grams of the Filco TKL keyboard (including its built-in cable).  Placing the keyboard on my desk, I found that it sat level with no wobble, with or without the legs extended. Without the legs extended, the rubber strips on the bottom of the case keep the keyboard from slipping. However, with the non-rubberized plastic legs extended, the keyboard slideswhen pushed, but with normal typing, it stays put. With the legs extended, the slope of the keyboard is essentially the same as that of my other keyboards, providing a comfortable angle for typing.

Like the Ninja keycaps on the Filco, the CM Stealth has relatively thin ABS keycaps with non-printed tops and printing on the front. The font is an unattractive attempt to be futuristic; nevertheless, I found the legends to be reasonably legible on the alpha keys, but a bit too small on the F-keys and number keys.

The detachable USB cable has gold-colored contacts, and the outer insulation on the cable is braided. The cable wire is very stiff; if you bend it, the bend stays put. I would prefer a more flexible wire. The micro-USB connector fits into a recessed area underneath the rear-center of the keyboard that is part of a cable routing system. The cable can exit from the center, right, or left of the keyboard, depending on your preference. At first, I tried to connect the keyboard using another cable that I already had connected to my computer. However, I could not connect it, because the recessed area under the keyboard was too short for the connector, requiring me to use the cable that was supplied with the keyboard.

TYPING

The first thing I noticed when typing on the new board was that the green switches required noticeably greater force than the blue switches on my other keyboards. This is exactly what I wanted, and I find the green switches a great improvement over blues. They are of course nothing like the buckling springs in my IBM Model M or IBM SSK, but I now know that greens are my favorite Cherry switch. I hope that all keyboard manufacturers who use Cherry switches will make Cherry greens one of the standard options. Now that I have tried greens, I do not want to go back to blues.

Being accustomed to buckling springs, my typing style is to bottom out with every keystroke. On the CM QFR, I found that the feel and sound of the keys was uniform across the board. To my delight, the larger stabilized keys with their Costar stabilizers were amazingly smooth and free of rattles. Although I appreciate Cherry stabilizers when I am replacing keycaps, and I have previously failed to detect a functional advantage of Costar stabilizers on other keyboards, the implementation of Costar stabilizers on the CM QFR is wonderful.

CONCLUSION

This is an excellent and handsome TKL keyboard. My only quibbles with it are the choice of font on the front-printed keycaps, lack of room in the USB connector recess, stiffness of the USB cable, question about potential erosion of the rubberized coating on the case, and lack of rubberized feet on the extendable legs. Therefore, my overall rating is 4 stars; if CM addresses these relatively minor points in future versions of the keyboard, it would rate 5 stars. The Cherry green switches get 5 stars; the only thing better is the IBM buckling spring. It would also be nice to have dye-sublimated thick PBT keycaps, but this would be more appropriate for the non-stealth version of the keyboard.

Although promoted as a gaming keyboard, I find normal typing on the CM QFR with Cherry greens to be smooth, fast, accurate, and highly enjoyable. In fact, the sound and feel of typing on the CM QFR with Cherry greens is much better than typing on my Filco MJ2 TKL with Cherry blues. Although the difference between the two boards must be due in part to the difference between Cherry blues and greens, there are other factors at work to make the overall typing experience better with the CM QFR.

I can highly recommend the CM QFR as a great all-around keyboard, as suitable for the office as for gaming. I also applaud CM for providing Cherry green switches as an option. Now I would not want to go back to Cherry blues, and I hope that other keyboard manufacturers will soon make Cherry greens a standard option.",CM QFR Stealth Cherry MX Green Switches -- Detailed Review,1376438400,70,"{'Size:': ' Small', 'Color:': ' Stealth - CherryMX Green'}",

The sensors are in four large feet at each corner of the board, which makes it better at measuring your precise weight distribution.  The board can detect your center of gravity, which is then used in the training and games.  I was very happy with the variety of games that come with the included Wii Fit CD.

The one thing I did NOT like about the included software is that it is totally intended for use by ONE player.  My wife and I wanted to take turns on the games, which worked OK on the soccer-ball header game.  But on the other games it was impossible for me because I am so much heavier than her.  In order to change to my Mii (with my associated weight data) we had to exit completely out of Wii Fit software and go back in.  That takes forever.  NINTENDO SHOULD WRITE A SOFTWARE UPDATE SO THAT YOU CAN CHOOSE ""RETRY WITH A DIFFERENT MII"" AFTER A GAME (or let you select multiple Miis when entering the Wii Fit suite of programs).  This would make the Wii Fit games a lot more fun for multiplayer and parties.  If they did this, I would give it a 10.  As it is, I give it a 8.

Description:

It is entirely plastic with a little heft to it. It sports a plastic arcade style stick along with 6 colorful buttons each assigned to the various buttons on the Xbox controller. The start/select, left/right bumpers are located at the top. Microphone jacks are located at the bottom and a 10ft cable connects the controller to the Xbox. Overall a good, clean looking fight stick.

Performance:

Both the arcade stick and the buttons feel responsive. The controller itself is comfortable and can be played on both the lap and a table top. The fight stick can also be used to play old fashioned arcade style games,but the arcade stick represents the d-pad so games that don't use the d-pad cannot be played with this. It works great in the games I play, but is not recommended for the competitive scene. The fight stick isn't made with tournament grade materials so competitive players should look elsewhere.

Overall:

Fighting game noobs like me should start off with this. It's great for its price and teaches the fundamentals of using a fight stick and is great for some casual play. If you do have a lot more money, I'd recommend aiming for a more expensive fight stick than this as the materials used may not be as durable as a more expensive fight stick.

There is a HUGE following of 3D nuts out there that buy anything 3D related, and well, I am one of them. :) LOL The 3D in this game did not disappoint, It adds an extra level of fun and realism to the already fun game.

The game itself is just about like the other Motorstorm's with a bit more realism in the controlling of the vehicles and the superb graphics. This iteration allows you to play 4 PLAYERS ON SPLIT SCREEN while offline! That part has me stoked! There are just too many racing games out there that only allow one player unless online and this is not one of them. If you have 4 players playing you can still go online with all 4 players and then have a total of 16 drivers all racing the same track! Today in May of 2017 you will be hard pressed to find that many players online at one time but a few are to be found if you wait a bit, I might be one of em ;)

 The cars are a little hard to control at times and not s forgiving as the other iterations of this game. I myself like that aspect as I isn't just some cheesy driving game that does all the work for you. There are 40 levels, or tracks to drive on and each is unique. A real nice aspect to keep things freash is the fact that thes tracks will change up on you at different times. For example, one time it may be sunny, next the same track is overcast and raining or it may be darker like at dusk. It keeps the game fresh and I like that! There are a plethora of cars to choose from so you won't find yourself getting bored with those.

The only reason I am removing 1 star is the fact that the only way to really upgrade to new skins or add-ons for your car is to play online. This makes it a little bit of a problem for those with slow or no internet. The game developers need to stay away from online upgrading as an only choice because some people just don't have internet yet and some people have slow internet. So gagin for that reason I am removing one star.

If you've seen the ads, it looks like an ugly game that features a lone warrior.  The opposite is true!  It's a great looking game and you've got a companion through 99% of the adventure... and she's wonderful!

Story 8/10
The Prince meets a magical Princess named Elika, who's on the run from palace guards.  He comes to her aid mostly due to his own bravado, rather than her actual need for rescuing.  He gets drawn into a magical adventure where he must help Elika save her kingdom from an evil God who's contaminated the land with a black corrosive slime called The Corruption.  Comic Book Fans will recognize this stuff as Spiderman's Symbiotic Suit.  The story is epic and the romantic chemistry between the characters is great!  85% of the dialogue is really good and 15% misses the mark.  If you can ignore a few bad lines, you'll feel for the characters and enjoy a few laughs.  Most of the dialogue is initiated by YOU, the player.  An icon appears on the lower left corner of the screen and if you press LT, you talk to Elika.  She tells you about the history of the kingdom, gives you hints on puzzles, and flirts.

Graphics 9/10
The game uses the tech from Assassin's Creed to render some of the most beautifully crafted and fantastically designed levels of all time.  The game is slightly cell shaded which adds to the fairytale atmosphere.  Both the Prince and Elika look and move great.

Gameplay:  Exploring 8/10
The Prince and Elika must traverse the dangerous environments and get to the Fertile Grounds.  Once they get there, Elika heals the land and removes the corruption.  Navigating the environments has never been easier.  Elika is the best companion ever!  She's single, hot, intelligent, and she grabs you and teleports you to safety every time you fall.  The game doesn't record ""Deaths"" it records ""Saves!"" as in the number of Times Elika saved your life.  If you can beat the game with under 100, you get an achievement.  Good luck with that.  But having her save your life and saying something witty is much better than the old, fall to your death, continue prompt, Yes decision, level reload, 20 seconds of your life gone x 500 times.  Suck it - Prince of Persia Warrior Within!  Anyway, Elika can go wherever the Prince can go and they help each other get through the levels.  You guide the Prince through the levels, jumping, using magic, and props the entire way.  Moving the Prince requires the D-Pad and generously timed button presses to use the props.  You will climb on, over, through, up, down, around, some truly amazing levels!  There might not be enough challenge for the Hard Core gamers because you don't have to aim jumps.  You simply need to time your button presses well.  If you get lost, Elika can summon a magical comet to show you where you need to go.  She's the best companion ever!
Once she heals the land, Power Seeds appear all over the level.  At that point, you and Elika can explore and collect them.  After you get a certain amount, Elika gains new powers.

Gameplay:  Combat 6/10
There aren't many enemies to fight in the game and when you find one, you fight them one at a time.  The combat system is modular.  The Prince has sword combos, gauntlet combos, air combos, and magic combos via Elika that can be strung together to create compound combos.  You're going to have to figure out how to link them yourself while you are fighting.  Despite this, the combat feels restrictive.  Too often the enemies enter a state which makes them immune to all but one of your combos or they initiate 'press the right button fast' or 'mash x' minigames.  At times, I just wanted to fight!  But the game had me jumping through so many hoops, I'd get frustrated.  If an enemy is about to kill you, it's Elika to the rescue.  If the combat was better, I would have given this game a 5.

Replay Value: 4/10
You can go to the levels in any order, but the path through them is linear.  The combat is also restrictive, so it's hard to have fun there.  The only reason to replay is for achievements.  Try to finish it without Elika saving you 100 times or collecting extra Power Seeds.  Playing through the game once takes about 12 hours.

Overall, the game makes innovative leaps to reduce the frustration associated with platforming games.  If you're a casual gamer with a romantic heart and you want a fairytale adventure, this game was made for you!

If you want the combat from the previous games or environmental challenges, you may want to skip this game... or at least rent it.

From reading reviews and watching screenshots of the game, RE5 had the same ""over the shoulder"" view as well as the game fighting infected africans during ""broad daylight"" really turned me off not to mention a side-kick partner to assist you which would take all meaning of scare and fright right out the door. So, thinking capcom did whatever it took to intentionally or unintentionally ruin an otherwise classic, I thought the day would never come when I would play RE5. Well, I have played it and here are my thoughts...

I have played all the resident evil series but unlike the rest of 'em, this has you go through the game with an annoying and rather useless AI partner which incidentally takes most of the fright out of a survival horror game. Interestingly enough on professional difficulty the AI partner does a decent job of fending its own and not getting in your way. Remember to have infinite ammo on the hardest level-professional difficulty because ALL the enemies take alot less damage from you and will ONLY attack you and it seems they just ignore your AI partner.

QTE'S (quick time events). In one word...HATE. These were thrown in the mix and are completely out of place during playthrough and is a chore and agony to get through. Not that it's overly difficult but cuts the flow of gameplay to button mashing with whatever the onscreen prompt comes up. Hopefully in the next game, all the qte's are not included.

The controls are pretty much the same as RE4 so it's bad. You can't run and shoot nor can you run and reload hence the advantage of upgrading your weapons and getting infinite ammo. Aiming is also a pain for most of your guns except the rifles which has a scope. 3rd person aiming view is clumsy and outdated.

There were scary moments in the game but nowhere near the level of previous iterations where you go through dark places and eerie atmospheres all alone. And the fact that most of the time your fighting with your AI partner's annoying actions like blocking your view doesn't help in the fear factor. Playing as sheva is more annoying because AI chris is so big that blocking your view is more constant and frequent. It also seems AI chris is alot dumber than AI sheva.

The game took me 8 hrs first playthrough on normal and another 6 hrs on amassing a sizeable wealth inorder to upgrade all my weapons and get infinite ammo by repeating a chapter over and over again.

If you have a friend, co-op is where the game really shines. No more annoying AI partner and you can go through your favorite chapters using strategy and team work such as one being a sniper and the other close range with a M3 shottie.

Lastly, the graphics are high grade and detailed. Some people say graphics aren't important, it's the gameplay. Well, it's a relative statement however the graphical detail definitely makes playing more enjoyable.

Overall, the game does have decent replay value and was fun all the way through. Make sure you don't sell your copy of RE5 because in early spring 2010 DLC will be available on PSN where you get to play as jill valentine called ""alternative edition"" with other extras.",IT WAS STILL SCARY AT TIMES BUT I HATE QTE'S,1258416000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

It starts out slow (and a little boring), but once you get past the Apartment buildings, the pace picks up a bit, and the closer you get to the end, the more fun it is.
My only beef is that although the storyline is much clearer than the first SILENT HILL, it's nowhere as scary!  It still captures the moodiness and mystery, but only a quarter of the fear.  When playing the first game, I was terrified out of my wits.  SILENT HILL 2 plays more like the RESIDENT EVIL series with straight-forward monsters which you have to kill (provided you have ammo).  It's not until later (with nightmare versions of the town) that the old SILENT HILL touch comes into play -- but even then it's not as intense.
All in all, it is a game that's worth buying, but if you're a big SILENT HILL fan, just keep your expectations down a bit and you'll have fun.  The endings are great too (all 5 of them), so keep working.","Great game, but not as scary as the first Silent Hill",1001808000,2,,

There are no badly designed sections or goofs in the flow - the only screw ups that happen are the ones you make. The character never makes unexepcted jumps or overshoots things etc.

That said, there's not much to do but fight a boss, work your way to the next one, and fight him too (enjoying the eye-candy the whole way). There are few other characters to interact with and no real sidequests or anything. The story itself takes a couple of mild twists and turns, but its not exactly Finnigan's Wake.

I didn't like the boss fights - you can pull off some cool combo's, but they're difficult to execute before the boss blocks a move and you win up just defending and slashing with your sword.

As others point out, you can't die. I like the fact that you can't die while working the 'platform' part of the game, but the boss fights become a joke since you risk nothing by simple swinging your sword until you beat the boss - it may not be your best move, but what the heck, you're immortal - take your time. In the end, the fight WILL end with you winning.

  That is great to an extent.  I love being able to sit down and play a quick game that still offers some strategic challenge.  Not having to micro manage everything really has its advantages.  The graphics are very well done, and its a blast getting into wars with your fellow neighbors and barbarian tribes.

  Having said that,  I do wish they would do away with the whole cutoff date of 2100.  At that year, whatever civ is in the lead is assumed the winner.  I have found the only reliable way to win the game before that cutoff date is to conquer other lands with your military.  Its difficult to win by sending your spaceship to Alpha Centauri.  Towards the end of the game you feel entirely rushed and that is unfortunate.

4.0,True,"03 9, 2011",A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B003ZHMMEM,Armando N. Roman,"I was fortunate enough to have an SNES when the first Donkey Kong Country hit stores in 1994. That game changed everything in the console war between Nintendo and Sega, and the graphics alone blew everyone's mind. Essentially, DKC was a Super Mario World clone, but my god did it have style. 5 animal friends, 101 hidden bonus stages, hands down the best soundtrack I've heard in a game, and it was just plain fun. DKC2 was just as strong, but DKC3 lost a lot of people, myself included. Since then, the poor gorilla was stuck with bongo games on the GameCube, which were fun and all, but not the DKC that many were hoping for. Retro Studios revives another franchise, and does great things once again. And while I really, really wanted to give this game 5 stars, a couple of big cons that stuck  through the whole game held it back. Still, this is one of the best platformers I've -ever- played, and I have nothing but high hopes for an improved sequel.

The story is simple- Donkey Kong's beloved bananas have been stolen once again, but not by the Kremlings this time. No, it's a bunch of little tiki masks with magical powers. As you progress through the game, you'll find out that somehow the bananas power the tikis, and they want to make more and more of them...hence why they took so many freakin' bananas. Donkey Kong isn't too keen on his banana stash being stolen again, so he and his buddy Diddy go out once more to make things right in the jungle. DKCR is a platformer just like the previous entries, meaning you'll do a lot of running and jumping, bouncing on enemies, collecting items and discovering secret areas while taking out some pretty nasty bosses.

First things first, Retro really did a heck of a job here. From the minute Donkey Kong clobbered a tiki and jumped out of his tree house, and that classic track kicked in, I felt like I was 9 years old in 1994 again. And don't get me wrong- I'm not one of those people who thinks that something's good just because it makes me nostalgic, but everything felt so right at first. Very rarely do I stop and enjoy the scenery and level design in games anymore, or kamikaze myself and jump off ledges to find a secret area, but my old way of playing games was revived with DKCR. They took the first DKC for the foundation of this game, but have truly made a new game, not just a remake. The art direction is a sight to behold, especially the levels where you just see Donkey Kong as a silhouette, with his red tie being the only other color. Gameplay is classic DKC, right down to collecting the KONG letters and extra life balloons, and succeeding or failing in bonus stages. Stages range from the jungle, beach, rocky cliffs, a volcano, and more. There are just the right amount of levels in each world, as well as a secret level for each one if you get all the KONG letters in every stage. This is something that drove me to collect everything, knowing that getting all the letters was necessary for entering a secret area after you beat the game. In addition to this, there are puzzle pieces in every level, and if you collect them all in one stage, it opens some bonus artwork on the main menu to look at.

Now, a ton of people have complained about how hard this game is. I won't deny it- I probably died over 400 times by the time I beat the game. Like New Super Mario Bros, DKCR is very generous with extra lives. You can even buy them from Cranky Kong with the of banana coins you find. But where this is much different from New Super Mario Bros is that the levels are actually tough. This game does not hold your hand once, and if you think you've reached a dead end, you're going to have to sit there and think about how to advance until you get it. Techniques like rolling off a ledge, then jumping in mid-air, were big in the original games, and very useful here too. Veterans of the older games won't have as much of a problem with some of the trickier areas here, but there are some other levels I'll mention in a minute that will. The boss battles weren't that tough, but sometimes it's hard to get the timing just right without dying a few times. If you scoffed at them giving Donkey and Diddy an extra hit each, rather than dying with one hit each, playing a couple stages in the cliff world will slap some sense into you, and you'll be thanking the heavens when you find an extra heart or DK barrel...or a checkpoint. Yes, this game did get hard in some places, but it seemed like the difficulty wasn't consistent. There'd be times when I'd breeze through 6 stages in a row, hit a tough one where I'd die 30 times, then I'd moonwalk my way through some more. And if all else fails, you can bite the bullet and let the checkpoint pig do the work, and he'll have a white Donkey Kong clear the stage for you. You can still advance to the next stage, but the one you needed help with will remain red on the map screen, and all the power ups you got won't count. I never used this option because of that very reason, but I can see why they put it in here. But I'll tell you, beating a tough level, or even quick area where fast paced platforming went on, I felt accomplished, and was happy. Usually when I get past a hard level in a game these days, I think nothing of it and move on. Here? As frustrated as I might've gotten at times, I felt like I was getting the hang of things.

As for what keeps the game from getting 5 stars, I'll bring up the obvious first- waggle. There's absolutely no reason why I should have to shake the Wii remote for DK to do a simple roll attack. NO REASON. In the old games, it was a push of the Y button, and DK would roll, or Diddy would cartwheel. Here, you have to shake the controller, and playing with the Classic isn't an option. One of the reasons I died so many times in a stage would be because of this, and I kept wishing that there were a Classic feature, or way to just program the roll attack to one of the buttons that wasn't used for anything else. Imagine having to shake the controller to make Mario shoot fireballs. Yeah, it wouldn't be fun would it? Fortunately, you can do most of the attacks with barrels or jumping on enemies or with Diddy's rocket pack, but when you have to roll off a ledge and then jump for an extra boost, it'll drive you crazy. Shaking the controller for slamming on the ground is fine, and fun since it makes sense, but not for a main attack. Next, the lack of animal buddies. Rambi's here, and so is Squawks (to an extent), but that's it. No Clapper, Winky, Espresso, Enguarde, Squitter, Rattly, etc. Don't get me wrong- riding Rambi and smashing through everything is way more fun here than it was in the first DKC, but I would've liked some more variety, or even more chances to use him rather than like 5 times. Co-op play is pretty bad too, and the less said about that, the better. If you're playing with a friend, just take turns when you die. It'll be less stressful. I also don't like the fact that the only way to play as Diddy Kong on his own is with a second person playing. If you're playing by yourself, you're stuck with Donkey. Finally, the main thing most people hate- the mine cart and Rocket Barrel stages. I actually didn't mind the mine cart ones until near the end, when you could only make a jump if you jumped off your current rail at the absolute last second, but it did get tricky later on. The Rocket Barrel stages are just cruel, and I made the mistake of joking to myself 'watch, the last boss is just a Rocket Barrel stage'. As it turned out, that's how you GET to the boss in the final level, and is a part of the level too. Ugh. Just when you get the hang of these stages, it'll throw a curve ball, and you'll have to watch out for things coming up behind you, not just in front. Oh, and my final complaint? No underwater levels at all. Not one. What gives?

Visually, the game is beautiful, and maintains the classic Donkey Kong Country look. There's nearly no slowdown until the last 5 stages, and they have some creative animations in here. The music is just as good, though for a diehard fan of the first DKC's soundtrack, it's a mixed bag. Some of the tracks from that game (and the sequels) are here, and redone...and they sound really good. But the rest of the tracks aren't very memorable, and I wish they would've just had a totally new soundtrack, and tried to make it great.

In the end, I enjoyed this game from start to finish, and it never left my Wii. I was determined to get everything in it, and felt great when all was said and done. The difficulty isn't as bad as say...getting an S rank in Ikaruga or clearing the last level of Metal Slug 3 with one life, but it's pretty high, if only because of those crazy Rocket Barrel stages. Any platformer fan, or anyone who wants to feel like a kid again playing the first DKC, I wholeheartedly recommend this.

This latest version UTIII has a couple of levels that make it worth what I paid 100%.  Really, it's a nice looker too!  Some of the levels are just gorgeous, and I love the revamped levels from the original game. The vehicles are really fun to pilot, just like the ones from UT04. The gameplay is pretty solid, although I had some problems finding people to play against online.  ???  Still, I enjoy the single player experience probably more than your average player.  The bots seem to have excellent AI.  Another negative, it doesn't have as many game style options as UT04, which I hope will be fixed in UT4, when they get around to producing it. So...keep your copy of UT04.  Now, why only 3 stars?  I ran into a problem running it on my particular PC and I was offered only a workaround.  It takes longer for me to get a game up and running because I have to switch user accounts just to play this one game.  I end up playing UT04 much more.  Specifically, when I try to run on my regular XP user account it will tell me my code is invalid, which it isn't, I bought my game.  I've read where people have rebought the game hoping to fix the problem and it doesn't work.  :(  I plan to pick up the BLACK version, even though I know that won't fix the problem either.

The worlds are massive with lots of vibrant colors, whacky enemies, catchy music, and most importantly, gameplay.

The only downsides to this game are Mario's horribly annoying voice, an occasionally fussy camera, and the possibility of graining your N64 control stick when you fight Bowser. These minor neusances are mild though and they don't really hinder the gameplay. All other downsides merely point to the characters themselves: Mario speaks with a bad Italian accent voiced by Charles Martinet instead of his old Brooklyn one from the cartoon series. I also don't like the changes made to Princess Toadstool. Instead of the spunky redhead from the cartoon series, she seems more like a ""dumb blonde"" with a weird voice.

There are things I love, and things I don't love about this game....allow me to share:

PROS:

LEVELING UP is so much fun....from health to new combos, to harder attacks and bonuses, the leveling up is great.

STRUCTURE: The game tends to keep you moving, just nudging you in the right direction either into a side mission or main mission.

WEAPON CHOICES: From bricks to golf clubs to chain saws, there is an unlimited supply of stuff to kill zombies with.

INDIVIDUAL ZOMBIES: You definitely get the feel that these zombies have less of a pack mentality than the first one.

GRAPHICS: The graphics seem to be good, but that is my opinion and I am not much of a graphics guy per say.

COMBO WEAPONS: These can be created easily, and on the fly without a work bench....I find them easy to do which is great.

BOSSES: I completely love bosses....if I can have a boss, I'm a happy guy, it's classic video gaming!

CONS:

Camera: Sometimes I feel like the camera is doing what it wants, and not showing me the perspective I need..

Lag in controls....sometimes I feel like the controls are not doing what I ask of them in a timely manner.

The tricky thing is...This is acctually a Prequal.  The game shows how this whole Zombie incident happened.  How the Stars Members met there fait and thus the nightmarish adventure of Chris and Jill.  In this though our hero's are Rebecka Chambers and Bill Coehn.  Both are likable just like Chris and Jill.  The game has a simple Plot which I won't get into but I must say this is a great game but also a huge disapointment.

The games biggest aspect was the story!  Alot of people wanted a really good, decent god honest truth on how this alstarted.  Well it really doesn't expect that this was more of a side story then the real thing.  The game gives you somethings like who did all those things in the Mansion in RE1 and some other plots but ultimatley there is just so many plot holes in the game.  The game had an ok story but I wish you could have more simpathy for Rebecca and Billy, which you do, but they don't show as much emotion as what Jill and Chris go through.  The game does feel like a side story then a real pure prequal/sequal.  The game also features some good twists which keeps you playing on and on but not good enough!  The game features some RE1 characters like Weskers and Enrico and some more characters that didn't have enough spot light in RE1 or RE0 either!  I mean it's a prequal you're suppose to show things before what happend man!  Like I said before..there is too much things left out.  Now that I got that out of the way..

The gameplay is pretty solid like the rest of RE games and this one is no different.  The game is pretty good just as good as the Remake and has some really cool creatures that are not seen in any other RE game.  The Crimzin heads are gone but that doesn't take away the feel or fright you get from this game.  The game scores big time on music and I really loved the music in this game, especially the parts were you're in the saving room.  The game has some really memorable music and is one of my favorites in anygame other then Zelda Oot.

Other then Music and gameplay the visuals in this game are abosolutley incredible and amazing.  One of the most memerable parts in the RE series is the Train scenario in RE0 which is absolutley amazing.  The graphics and background of the train station is just sooooo realistic.  The visuals score big time and are just as good if not better then the visuals on the Remake.  The zombies look even more realistic in RE0 then in REmake.  Simply...The graphics in this game are awesome and one of the best in the gamecube.  The weapons look just as good as the characters and I must say the character models for both Rebecca and Billy look incredible.  The visuals in this game Get a * just...Awesome..

The new Zapping system is really great too.  It's a great addition to the RE series.  You can switch between partners to do puzzles and switch ammo, Guns and medicene.  The Zap system is a really fun to but do no think your characters will always be together NO-HO this game will have you fighting for your life...ALONE...in some parts in the game and that's another thing that I loved about RE0 is that when the two main characters are back together you'll feel somewhat...safe..In the game.  It's truly a great edition in the game.

4 stars because I have to customize, the developers NEED to Edit teams etc. Nonetheless, the customization at the same time is where its at, since you can move players around. Which is a good give or take. NOW, this game is not much better than THE OTHER soccer game, lets be honest, we all HATE the scripting/handicapping/momentum bla bla bla that goes with the OTHER TITLE, but we know deep down in our hearts that the OTHER TITLE keeps the competition alive. If the PES team wants to win, its simple:
1) Bolster the game comentary (Commentary really matters, make it more robust)
2) Tweak the gameplay mechanics and balance the arcade feel with a little more realism (The goal keepers are weak!)
3)Can we get some jerseys please. If you want us to customize, then don't ask full price. Some of us actually prefer to save money
4) Clean up the User Interface. Wow! Have you seen how clean and colorful the User Interface on the OTHER TITLE is? Hire a psychologist that specializes in these things.
5) Get some serious catchy music. Hint: Reggaeton is catchy for a soccer game, just saying. Also, keep the track ""Elevate"" by St. Lucia, tis a good song.
6) Get alpha, beta and even kappa testing of this game if needed. Get some serious critical reviews. I feel like most of the blogs written about PES 16 was just to give it some kind of credit. I have this and the OTHER title and i still jeep going back to play the OTHER title, so its not there yet, for me anyways.

My worries were sort of at ease after I began the game. Instantly, I noticed some flaws. If your like me, you just touch a mode and assume they're going to explain the version to you, well they don't. Instead you have to look for a (fairly small) ""Demo"" button.

In each round, players inspect three or four rooms at a time, trying to find a list of hidden objects. Most of the items are random, but some are clues which contribute to the murder mystery. Players can also question witnesses for more information, and in between each round is a little (very easy) puzzle that provides you with some kind of evidence - you may have to re-create a letter, for example, or test an unknown liquid.

Overall, this game is a lot of fun. Nearly all of the objects are reasonably disguised. I might not have found them all, but when I used the hint feature, my reaction was generally, ""Oh, I should have caught that."" The plot is a somewhat stripped-down version of Christie's novel; most of the subplots are gone, but it will probably entertain people who aren't familiar with the story. I particularly like the way that the objects in each person's room helped define their character - Colonel Race, for instance, has a hunting theme in his room, while Miss Bowers has a lot of medical objects. The music was also really well done, although the game probably could have used more variety.

If I have one complaint about this game, it's that it is really a bit short, considering the price tag. The game was originally available as a download, and it shows: there is no spoken dialogue (just subtitles), very little animation, and only 12 game levels.

There are so many good RPG games out there just waiting to be played, and I overlooked them because of my addiction to the early Halo games and Starcraft. What was I thinking? Well no matter, because now that I once again own a PS2 and a PS3 I now have the ability to partake in those games. Starting with Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love and now moving into the Persona series with Persona 3 FES, my first Persona game but in no way will this be my last.

By that statement you can probably guess I liked Persona 3, and you would be right. This game was a pleasure to play, sitting down for hours on end and grinding levels in Tartarus, this game's dungeon, or just working on my relationship levels with friends. The main plot was good, but what really attracted my attention were the little stories I made with those I created social links to. And let's not forget that the combat is turn-based, something I adore and miss in the newer JRPGs. Did the game have its failings? Yeah, but they were mostly minor things that never stuck with me. Well, besides the fact that there was no Japanese dialogue option.

For those of you who don't know, Persona 3 is about a young man, who you name, who can enter the midnight hour along with several others. He, along with some of the others, can summon these metaphysical creatures from their souls to battle against the shadows that exist within a giant towering dungeon called Tartarus. Their goal is to find a way to destroy Tartarus and the midnight hour, but along the way they encounter resistance and eventually learn the terrible truth behind Tartarus' purpose. It's a story filled with some nice twists and turns, although the end result is always the same. This did annoy me a little, but due to what you learn in 'The Answer', a second story that takes place shortly after the end of the original game, not all hope is lost for a character who I had spent so much time building into the perfect bro and exceptional lover.

It's the social links I am speaking of, connections formed with other NPCs and your party. These connections have the effect of increasing your affinity with a certain genre of persona, meaning the closer you become to those connections the stronger your personas can become. And while it's all well and good, I pursued those connections more for what kind of story they told me. These little story lines are where I was really invested, the characters you meet in them and learn about and become closer to were all interesting. Like the shady business man who takes you under his wing, a shy and quite treasurer for the student council who might be a closet yandere, a friendly little girl whose parents are going through a divorce, or even a player in an MMORPG within the game who turns out to be your homeroom teacher. FYI, I was so down that the teacher never gets some alone time with the protagonist like the other girls that I went and read fan fiction of such a scenario. Because when you learn who it is, and when she learns who you are, her reaction is just so god damn adorable.

Now while I did eventually grow use to the English voices, which still don't sound as good as the Japanese voices, the translation saw many changes to the content to make the game for ""English Friendly."" Jokes, cultural references, and common terms were altered as to not leave those with no knowledge of the Japanese and Japan in the dark. Problem is, the only people who would even consider playing a JRPG, are those who like the Japanese and Japan. Take note I said JRPGs, not just RPGs, so changing up all those points in the translation seems like a damn shame. They did their best, I'm sure, but even I could notice when things just didn't really click properly. Had this been left alone, the game might have done even better with me.

4.0,False,"06 6, 2006",AKMJJES6FE2M5,B0001YM04E,Andrew C.,"I've never been big on first-person shooter (FPS) games, although I've played a few, like Star Wars: Battlefront 2, that I've found entertaining. So, getting this game was taking a chance, since I'm partial to real-time strategy games and roleplaying games.  Overall, I must say that I've really had a good time with UT 2004. It hasn't made me more of a fan of the FPS genre, but I am definitely looking forward to UT 2007.

Gameplay: The controls are the typical mouse, WASD keys, and hotkeys associated with FPS games, so anyone familiar with the FPS genre ought to be able to jump right in. You have a number of options for your in-game character, including race, gender, name, etc. You can also choose your AI teammates and the number on each team.  Additionally, there are ten game modes, including deathmatch, capture the flag (CTF), domination (requires you to hold two points), assault (objective based), bombing run (a deadly version of soccer), and onslaught (securing nodes and destroying the enemy base). There's fun to be had with each mode, but I suspect that most people will find the greatest replayabiity in the onsault, assault, CTF, and team deathmatch modes. The maps are large enough for some strategic thinking (especially on assault and onslaught), and the game comes with about 100 maps--with many more that can be downloaded from the internet.

AI opponents (""bots"") are very good in this game. They have strong attack scripts, good pathfinding, will follow orders, and generally work well as teams. I detected some of the typical AI cheating found in FPS games (i.e., extra health, amazing accuracy, accelerated movement) toward the end of the tournament and in some of the tougher matches, but generally the AI here is just plain challenging and well programmed. Although many will buy this game for the multiplayer side, the single-player content (which is all that I play) is quite strong. The game does not have a compelling story to tell, but the tournament mode lasted me 25-30 hours on ""experienced"" difficulty level. I don't feel a need to replay the tournament anytime soon, but there are a lot of individual maps and modes that are greatly replayable.

A few things that add a lot to the game are the variety of weapons available and the vehicles. Overall, none of the weapons are very overpowered, though some are better and more versatile than others. Some weapons are best suited for one situation, while others can be useful in some fashion under a number of conditions. A second element that adds variety to the game is the vehicles. I can't overemphasize how fun these can be. Not only do they break up the monotony of having to sprint on foot across the map, but they also add a new strategic and tactical layer to a game. Vehicles can be game winners, but they are not invincible. Some can carry multiple passengers, who can man various weapons or simply go along for the ride. However, to maintain balance, characters on foot have a few very strong anti-vehicle weapons, and many objectives cannot be completed by vehicles. Still, there's nothing like decapitating a fleeing opponent with the blades of a Scorpion buggy or hearing the thundering cannon of a Goliath tank.

The gameplay is frantic, exciting, and straightforward enough to appeal to a range of gamers. You never feel lost on the maps, since there is a good in-game mini-map and the objectives are always clear. Also, you never get the sense that you are babysitting your computer allies, since they act as intelligently--more so on many occasions--as the average human player. The game's flaws are mostly minor, but worth mentioning. First, there are a few rather frustrating missions in the tournament that the average player will have to repeat several times (at least on experienced difficulty and higher). And there is no way to adjust the difficulty level of the tournament once it starts. Also, the game-save system is automatic; the game saves after every match, win or loss. Thus, you can find yourself broke if you lose enough matches, and you'll have to play a series of qualifying matches to earn enough money to continue the tournament. It's a system that gets old quick and really adds a layer of repetition to the game that serves little purpose. Finally, some people will be put off by the amount of acrobatics that the game includes. On some of the more advanced levels and difficulty settings, AI opponents are hopping, flipping, and cartwheeling in ways that make them nearly impossible to hit, though they will seem to hit you just fine. I think that the game plays just a tad bit too fast and requires too much jumping around. But you'll get used to it.

Graphics: Great-looking game. The maps are very impressive in detail and size. Be sure to take a lot of screenshots! The models are all rendered well, from the characters to the vehicles. Weapon fire and particle effects look good, as does the natural environment, especially skies. Have no doubt about it, this is a very violent game. Dying animations are graphic, and people tend to end up in pieces or as skeletal remains. Overall, the art direction is rock solid.

Sound: Although decent, the audio is not as good as the visuals. Weapons such as miniguns and tank cannon sound like they should, along with footsteps, flowing water, and other ambiant effects. In-game AI characters tend to use the same list of taunts such as ""Ownage!"" or ""You suck!"" or ""You be dead!""--along with a few choice obscenities--but none of the characters really stand out with individual personalities. The music is the typical techno fare found in many video games, nothing special.

Documentation/Stability: The manual that comes with the game is informative and makes up for a rather bland in-game tutorial. The game was pretty stable on my computer, though I experienced one freeze and one crash during the tournament. Overall, the game seemed well polished and optimized.

Replayability: Given the number of maps that come with the game, the developer's Bonus Pack that can be downloaded for free from the internet, the large number of player-made maps available, and the editor tools that you can use to make your own maps, this game has had a long shelf life. If you get tired of playing against the AI, you can go online and play against a human opponent. For me, about half of the 10 gameplay modes are not appealing after a few rounds, but the other 5 (especially assault, onslaught, and CTF) are always good fun.

To date he has purchased every Marvel 2.0 figure, and also Dash Jack Sparrow and Mike Wazowski, and waits with bated breath for each new character.  He enjoys playing with the figures and doing the missions, and just looking at the action figures.  The graphics are nice and the dialog of each of the characters is entertaining.

The missions are fun and he enjoys doing them.  So far, I believe he has completed all of them (although I am not sure about the Avengers). While he enjoys the missions he wishes he could interchange the characters from other groups into the missions. Hulk can't play in the Guardians of the Galaxy missions, and Groot can't play in the Avengers missions.  Part of the appeal of the Infinity set is the ability for different characters to interact with each other.  Disney never mentioned this could only take place in the toy box.

Speaking of the toy box, this is where my son spends most of his time these days.  Within the toy box he can add whatever monsters he wants and have any hero battle them.  He enjoys this, but wishes he could do this in the missions.  The slow loading tim is also an issue.  We almost always play two players and it can take 30+ seconds for the characters to load.

There is so much more Disney could do to expand this set, and I hope they do.  More missions, better interactivity between characters, and making sidekicks more customizable.

I pre-ordered UAW:EA and I usually don't pay games at the 60 dollar price point but I'm glad I did. These guys are the original C&C fans and they know how to make good in depth RTS games and I love to support such a great team. Unfortunately they sided with Sega which is not a publisher that I would care for. However overall this game is a ton of fun to play and the gameplay is great. The game is well balanced as with no patches at the moment and that is rare for many RTS games. I'd rate this game a 4 out of 5 being great but not perfect.

So a little of the story, Universe at War is a homage to Starcraft with three radically different races, you always feel like you are playing a different custom and culture when you play the Novus, Hierarchy, or Masari. The Hierarchy are an alien race moving from one planet to the next gobbling up the universe of life and now they have invaded Earth. Luckily the Novus are right on their trail and you find out that they have been fighting the Hierarchy for some time now. Later on you find where the Masari come into all of this but I don't want to spoil it for you and it is better to experience the story playing the game.

At first I played the game and had a bit of slow framerate issues and it happened to lock up on me twice. Then after checking out online references I found that there was a fix to this. In order to get smooth uninterrupted gameplay you have to clear your cache on your hard drive and turn up tactical speed, (speed when fighting in matches) which is located in the options menu of the game. After doing these two techniques, wow, the game runs smoothly and has never locked up on me since and I can't complain. A patch is in the works to fix a few things like allowing hackers to auto defend areas they are set to, fix the framerate issues from the start and mainly to add in the cross-platform playability.

One really nice feature here is how they made a PC RTS play and work on a console. The 360 controls are very intuitive but may be a bit of a learning curve to understand. The basics are the same, press A to select unit(s) and press A again to move them to that position. You can hold down the Right Trigger and this will blow up your map so you can see details and also allow you to order units using the minimap. I don't know how many PC games don't let you do this and it's a must in any RTS. Also all of your units are grouped in the beginning, all one type infantry, all one type anti-inf vehicles, anti-building vehicles, this type air units and your hero. It is all grouped for you so you don't have to make groups of similar units as you do in my PC RTS games or click and drag to select your army. The bumpers are used to select your research and your army. The LB allows you to scroll through the UAW themed circular interface to see what patch or upgrade you want to implement, what research you want to do, what super weapon ability you want to use. Accordingly the RB allows you to scroll through a similar interface and pick grouped units, the ones that have been grouped for you, and to also deselect those units. One advanced feature I found out was if you select all your units on the map and then hold down the RB and place the screen over the units you don't want, say units defending your base, and hit X you will deselect these units but not all of that unit type. Most of the people I've talked to about this game didn't know that and I find it is crucial to a good microing of your army. The controls are taught to you as you play the campaign so don't just jump into skirmish mode and think you can play.^^

Visually the game looks great, the graphics are top notch and you would have to have a high system PC to run it at the settings it is set for the Xbox 360. There are plenty of explosions and lush environments to make playing this on your TV or LCD monitor, (I play on the big TV in the living room and also on an extra LCD monitor in the den) a blast to look at. In audio terms, fans of Frank Klepacki can take a sigh of relief as the composer creates a slew of great sounding tracks for each race and the game uses an adaptive music system so it will change on the fly when you attack the enemy or it attacks you. I was really disappointed with C&C3 due to the repetitive dull environmental music they composed for it but you have the great electronic rock and roll sound you have come to love from Frank Klepacki in Universe at War. Also the game's voice overs are done well and the many other audio sounds of the game add great depth and feel to each race.

At the moment we're all waiting for Sega to ok the patch to allow cross-platform play as well as many other needed tweaks but overall the game is very fun to play and the amount of gameplay really adds to this fun. Playing as the Novus with their flow conduits and guerrilla warfare, the Hierarchy and their enormous Walkers that act as their movable assault bases, or the Masari with their enormous potential to harness nature and switch between light and dark mode all feel very different and not just different unit skins for each race. There is a 90 unit population cap, similar to Warcraft 3, and this is set in place to make games playable on the console, (the PC version also has the same pop cap) but to employ a good amount of strategy for the player to decide how and which units to use against their opponent be it AI or human. I can't really talk about the multiplayer as this option is not available to me due to the lack of broadband options for me, (only one I have is satellite which doesn't work well with games) but this game was created to be played against humans and with the real time strategy in mind. The single player allows you to play through the campaign of each race and to attempt to ""Conquer the World"", where you are taking place in a real time game of ""RISK"" fighting over one territory after the next. You also are given the typical skirmish matches with a ton of maps to choose which I haven't even delved into but will probably as I finish the scenarios conquering the world. Did I mention achievements yet?! lol

So overall this isn't the console RTS that will make people say yea this can be done on the console. It had a pretty rough start and the fact that when you make your units move to the location on the map the fastest by doubling clicking A, (instead of just hitting A), and your units move to that spot but don't stop and pursue any enemies on the way can cause some unrest in a few gamers. Personally I'm good a micromanaging since I've played RTS games on my PC from Dune 1 and it should be said that vehicles and air units will attack on the way but infantry will not. Really the game is a ton of fun to play, the controls are great and allow you to micro on a console, playing RTS games on your big TV are great, and the soundtrack for the game keeps you pumped and motivated to defend or take over Earth! Hope you enjoyed my review or it gave you a bunch of important info on the game. Don't take my word for it, give it a rent, you'll be glad you did.

Although it is not made by SquareEnix, it still shares some of the elements of FF:Tactics Advance.  While the story is as far out as the FF series, it still retains a lot of the plot twists and suspense that the other games have.

For of you who haven't had the chance to play any of these games allow me to introduce it to you.  Intelligent Systems, the people behind Advanced Wars and Paper Mario, have released an RPG based off the Japanese series Fire Emblem after Super Smash Bros. Melee introduced Marth & Roy and the people begged for it to be released (including me).  This game is not like SSBM in any regards, its totally different.  You play on a grid where you move your units around and attack your opponents.

I am a big fan of grid based combat, so I went and bought this game as soon as I could.  It has so many great elements to make a game good.  The thing that might shock other people, as it did me, as that as soon as one of the characters dies, they're gone for good, unless of course you want to restart the level.  This adds a huge amount of stratergy to the game.  Some of the characters that are weak would normally make me care less if they died, but in this game, they give you their background, and each has their own dying phrase.  The other thing is, your ending will be changed a little if any character dies.

The sound is spectacular, some of the best orchastrated music I've heard on a handheld.  Conversations can drag on a little sometimes, but that can be ignored by the music and the excellent storyline.

It starts out as your basic fairy tale about a girl finding out she's a princess and so on.  But then later the game takes on a much darker tone, which I don't want to spoil for those who haven't played the game.  Oh, and the other nice feature is the ability for your weapons to have 'health.'  Its similar to that of Dark Cloud's system, but different.  If you use a weapon too much, it'll break.  THe other neat feature is the extra chapters that can be obtained in various ways.

So overall, the game is pretty awesome.  I suggest that to everyone who has a gba, to pick this one up even if they hate these games.

PROS

- Excellent Storyline

- Great stratergy elements

- The Battle System works extremely well

I regularly read game reviews; consequently, pouring over the reviews of this game when it was first released caused me to wait a solid year before purchasing the sequel to my beloved 'Sands of Time.' I was foolish to wait, and foolish to listen to the naysayers out there. They whined about things like unintelligent level design, for example. Try CREATIVE and CHALLENGING. Whatsamatter, you don't like non-linear segments in your game play where you have to actually explore and think your way through a level instead of being led through it by convenient openings and 'go this way' landmarks? Too bad for you -- this isn't your game, then. And the very cool switching back and forth between the past and the present is interesting, not a programming shortcut. Some players also complain 'There's no persian architecture in this game -- whine whine whine!!' These guys must have missed the fact this game DOESN'T TAKE PLACE IN PERSIA!!! The set you're playing in is the Castle of Time -- OF COURSE it's going to look different!! Sheesh!!  Another common rant about this game is 'it's just not like Sands of Time, whaaa whaaa whaaa.' Duh, a sequel is supposed to be DIFFERENT, not exactly the same game you just played with a few tweaks. I LOVED Sands of Time, and I LOVE this game equally because it's DIFFERENT. Stunning visuals, gorgeous graphics, atypical look and feel, and yet just enough similarities to remind you you're still playing the part of the Prince, albeit ten years older and embittered by disappointment. HELLO, critics, remember when you whined after the release of the first game that the Prince was 'too youthful, too innocent, too kindly?' Well, you got your wish for a battle-hardened, uncaring and angry Prince and now you're all whining about THAT. Another thing people complain about in this game is the voiced responses of the numerous enemies you must kill, calling them cheesy and badly recorded. I'm sorry, but again I must disagree. While I'm not calling this addition genius or flawlessly executed, I definitely appreciated the interest it lent the game -- no longer do I feel as though I'm playing totally alone, pitted against mindless monsters who can only shriek, squawk, and grunt. For those of you who waited to purchase this game as long as I did (it was a Christmas present to myself) ;) don't wait any longer, especially at this attractive price.

I will never understand why this game has recieved some mediocre reviews. The only problem I see with this game is its graphics. Nobody is going to like this game just for its graphics. In my opinion the very first pokemon RPGs had better graphics than this game, for one simple reason: In those games the pokemon characters could be seen as large, cute images. In this game you will never see your stars any way other than as small (but well drawn and well animated) sprites.

Everything else about this game just seems wonderful to me. One very good thing is that this game can be played absolutely at any speed you want to. The game has features to run through dungeons very quickly, but it will always let you stop and think things out, and believe me, by the time you save the world you will have had some scenarios come up where you'll want to think out the best course of action.

By the time you save the world in this game you will have played 25 hours and will have witnessed one of the most charming stories in any video game. But the game hasn't even hit its stride yet. I only play extras after the story is finished in games if I really like the game and feel compelled to, and oh yeah I wanted to see what this game had to offer! Many of the game's features don't even appear until after the storyline is complete. Don't misunderstand, saying ""the storyline is complete"" in fact is not true, because really nice scenes long after the storyline resolve things that never really finish in the main storyline (the first 25 hours).

Once you've played 80 or 90 hours your heroes will be extremely strong, and none of the ordinary dungeons will be any challenge for you. BUT, this game includes two wonderful features (neither of them making any logical sense but that's alright) that will keep the challenge up even after that. The first is missions where you have to escort a weak pokemon deep into a dungeon. If your client gets beaten it is just as bad for your team as if your heroes are beaten. The bigger and better challenge-increasing feature is the three dungeons where your characters lose all their advantages (level and special abilities) every time they enter. Don't worry, they'll get all their levels back after they leave the dungeon. These ""level 1 dungeons"" are a really special challenge the likes of which I have only seen in Lufia games.

And I haven't even mentioned some of this game's coolest features. If you know someone else with the game, or have internet access, you can have your defeated team saved by someone else and have another chance at the dungeon. That feature's so neat I hope other games pick up on it and add it to their series. And hey, this is a Pokemon game, with - get this - 413 varieties of pokemon that can join your cause! Well, 28 of those are different Unowns so there are really only 386 recruitable species, but still it's impressive. After completing the story you can return to earlier dungeons with tough legendary-pokemon bosses like Zapdos and recruit them. And some of the non-legendary pokemon, like Chansey, are even harder to recruit than the legendaries. Another neat feature is that it IS possible to steal items from shops in the game, but you REALLY have to know what you're doing not to be beaten (without the chance to even be rescued). If you're dedicated and lucky enough to recruit the shopkeeper, you'll have a decided advantage in those level 1 dungeons I mentioned before.

If you only play till the end of the main story, this game has 25 hours of gameplay. But I think it's a safe bet you'll want to play more than that. If you play long enough to complete all the dungeons it'll take a little over 100 hours. That's pretty good for an RPG, BUT, if you really like this game and want to recruit every single pokemon, and want to get into the internet friend-rescuing scene, this game has 400 hours of play!!! That's amazing. I've logged 425 hours, and I still want to play more. And the graphics only bothered me about the first one-fourth of an hour.","Don't expect a traditional pokemon game, but this game is wonderful!",1169856000,24,,

This title not only ties into the storylines of the previous two games but adds so much more. The multiple factions you have to deal with form an intricate fabric that sometimes you forget who you're working for and who is looking to end your life.
The graphics and music are far more extensive and immersive than the previous games. Merging that with awesome level design makes you want to explore every nook and cranny just to see it all. Unlike other people who have said that playing earlier ""beta"" versions yielded no multi-level, multi-roomed mansions you're sorely mistaken. This game teems with huge complicated maps and manors.
The weapons array is, for the most part, the same as the last game minus the rope arrows. You get climbing gloves instead which have many tiny hooks on it to grasp vertical surfaces. Not all missions are condusive to climbing gloves but then again when it's available you'll use the heck out of them. There are a few more tricks in your arsenal and this time around you visit shops to buy/sell your loot and weapons. Nice addition!

ExerBeat has so many types of exercises - and the ability to set your workout time - that it fits the bill to match mood, motivation, and time constraints everyday.
Once you set your profile (using your Nintendo Mii, or creating a new one for the game), you move to a quick tutorial to show you what to do.  The game has a large selection of exercise sections including martial arts, boxing, aerobics dancing, hip-hop and Latin dancing, and stretching and body conditioning.  If you need more relaxation, this game even includes yoga and pilates, and a fun party section.  More sections unlock as you make progress.
If you're short on time, or you get bored, like me, with the same old routine day after day, ExerBeat is a good way to work out.  You really do sweat to these routines and, if you like to work out with a partner, you can work out together too (but you'll need extra controllers).

Nothing in my huge hamper o' cords, axial cables and connectors fit the bill, so I put down a couple of greenbacks on this adapter.

First, you must know that this box doesn't contain all you need forever, but it's a good start as long as you know this....you can play 'for free' for a trial of ten days (maybe a month in some cases, depending on what free trial you get?) but then..it's FIFTEEN DOLLARS A MONTH TO PLAY.

What do you get for that money?

You get to make I believe it's NINE characters which I will go into later.  This means mom can make one, dad can make one, the kids can each make one, then you can even make a few more.

Once you have those characters, you must delete one to be able to make one new one (or switch realms which I won't go into at all)...BUT only ONE PERSON can play at a time.  So if Dad is playing his Warrior, mom can't play her mage until dad is done.  Thus...you end up with three accounts like me :)

Next, you DO NOT HAVE to buy Wrath of Lich King or Burning Crusade now!  Or ever..but those expansions allow what used to be a max level char of 60...to go to 70 and so on.  I know you have no idea what that means if you are new to WOW...just know you don't need them yet.

So, you get this, load it, load patches (let me insert something important here.  If you do not have a GOOD computer with a GREAT graphics card, don't bother with warcraft.  This is a HUGE game with basically streaming video and intense graphics.  If you try the free time, it's a good way to know what will slow down your game etc...like the big cities usually will.  My brother in law had an e-machine that was 'only two years old' and it slows and stalls all over the game.) and now you are ready to go...

You choose a character (hunters are probably easiest to start off with) and you can change a few things about them like hair and such...but not much. This is no Sim's game.

You start out in an area, let's say, and what happens?  There is your hunter..and next to her/him you see a guy with a question mark over his head.  Run over to him, click on him.  He gives you a QUEST...dah dah dum!  Oh the drama...the excitement!  He may tell you to go find 7 of some plant.  You run around that area and will see something sparkle...it's the plant!  You run to them, click on them...them find more.  When you are done with the 7, they stop sparkling to tell you that you are done.  You run back to that guy and turn them in.  WOOHOO!  You get a new quest, some money (copper, silver and eventually gold) and some junk items you can sell for money.

All over the game are 'non playing characters' which will buy the junk and give you money.

Now the fun part...all over the game are OTHER REAL PEOPLE!  Let's say you log on and find my character running around!  We can run over to eachother, say hello, give eachother gold/silver/copper...chat about stuff, go do quests together in the game!

By the way, the game is HUGE. I am not kidding when I say we have all played for a year and a half.  You can start out playing in a snowy area with white tigers and funny looking old dwarfy things...then run to another area that is like a lush jungle with crocs and flying dragons...then to another area that is like being on mars...barren and rocky and tilted :)

There is a LOT to do in this game. Questing is the biggest part, you must complete quests like I said to 'level up'.  You start as a level one with limited armor and skills. It's easy to learn what you are doing, slowly, as the game progresses.  Then you complete quests and hit level two! Now you get a new skill, new armor to use!  At the time I wrote this today, the max level is 80.  When you are a level one, you hit level two within moments!  But it took me about a week and a half to go from 78 to 79!

Then there are 'professions' etc.  You can learn to fish..super easy to do, just get a pole and some bait (sold all over) and drop your line in the water.  You can do first aid..which means when you loot a bad guy you might get cloth mixed in with that silver/gold and quest items (like the plants we talked about earlier)..which you can click on to make into bandages! It's not tough.

I can't multitask much and I'm not born to win at video games.  This game is FUN and you learn as you go.

You can also join a guild, which means there are players that have come together to help other players who join their guild.  Fun, super helpful.

Rather than go on and on, let me say this...it's fun. It's addictive (the pattern is, you get wow...you play all night at first, then you call in sick to work, you plan your vacations around the game..) and I mean like ADDICTIVE.  But, there are bad things.  First, it's usually down ALL DAY LONG on Tuesdays...every Tuesday, for schedulted maintenance. Trust me, if you play, and are off on Tuesdays, you are going to be mad about this.

Also, there are jerks in 'chat'.  You can turn the chat off, and if you have kids I suggest you do.  There is always someone saying something crude in chat.  Blizzard does not care..they offer you to turn off chat or ignore one person at a time.

I have not even covered battle grounds...playing lots of players against lots of players! But suffice it to say, in my opinion, this is the greatest game ever designed.  If it was ten a month the whole planet would probably play.  If you have a great pc, get it.

Sure, NASCAR 4 has much better driving physics; the latest Need for Speed has better graphics; but nothing comes close to being as fun as the Midtown Madness games.
This second installment of the series (O how I eagerly await the third one) takes the gamer to two lovely cities, San Francisco and London.  I had just returned for a trip to London when I played this game last year, and was more than thrilled to be cruising and racing down the same streets I had set my foot on not so long before.  While not 100% accurate, the representations of the cities are remarkable and very fun to explore.
The driving, as has been pointed out many times by others, is rather arcade-like, which means two things: 1) it's easier than driving in the real world, and 2) it's more exciting than serious racing sims.  You can ram the other cars on the road as well as scare pedestrians (but not, as in Armageddon, kill them).  The cars, modeled after real-life roadsters, come in all shapes and powers, but are responsive and drivable even on a keyboard.  (I use driving wheels, which is a bit of an overkill for an arcade game like this, but does make you feel more in control.)
In summary, Midtown Madness 2 is by far the most playable racing game I've ever played.  It beats out Armageddon, Grand Theft Auto, Need for Speed, not so much in graphics but in the limitless ways you can have fun.","Fun, fun, fun",1001376000,21,,

I had already taken the original screen lens off, and that's where some people may be confused as it's quite a balance between delicacy and force as you have to peel the old one off and yet be careful not to damage the actual screen underneath. Anyway, having realized that there is a protective film on the front and back to protect the screen, I carefully peeled back the side with the adhesive then fixed it to my GBASP screen by aligning it with one of the corners. It's good to keep a can of air and even wear protective gear before adding the screen lens as the tiniest bit of dust will be sealed for life inside the two parts. I also used pre-moistened eye glass cleaning tissues to clean the screen completely before installation. Once it was on I then peeled back the protective film from the outside of the screen and installed it all back into the shell.

First of all, let me say this, like every ""souls"" game that came before it THIS GAME IS NOT FOR EVERYONE! THIS IS A DIFFICULT GAME.

That's not to say that it's unbeatable and that only some can master it. Take it from me, I DO NOT LIKE HARD GAMES! That being said, the fact that I'm absolutely in love with Bloodborne should be a testament to it's design and how great of a game this is. I was weary of Dark Souls, but you know what, I kept try and try and noticed that once you understand the game's mechanics and the enemy animations, you get good, really good, and when you defeat enemies that were once pummeling you to the ground incessantly, you get an immense rush of satisfaction and accomplishment, THAT IS WHY BLOODBORNE IS SOO GOOD!

The game is designed for the player to be able to learn from their mistakes and get better! But only those that stick with it will reap the fruits of becoming a better player and the HUGE satisfaction of overcoming once seemingly insurmountable odds. The game is difficult, but no unfair, so 95% of your deaths will be on you.

The gameplay is fun, fast, precise and intense. The battles literally will have your heart pounding.

It's the same with story, you have to put some work to find out what's going on. Now, Bloodborne is a little more generous with giving you clues to the story than it's predecessors, but you still have to read item descriptions and talk to NPC's to get most of it. As boring as that sounds, it's actually not. But on the plus side, there are many channels on youtube that do the dirty work and put the story together in a very comprehensible manner.

And you learn new skills, you can customize the armor and weapons of your characters, and the character image changes not like other RPGS that you upgrade armors, and helms, etc. But the carachter always looks the same.

This game is addictive, and if you have played any kind of RPG's in the past is very easy to pick up the gameplay. The Characters are from a sort of parallel world to the one of the trilogy, but still you visit and fight the same bad guys from the movies. You can also play as the bad guys once you have finished a chapter. You can also travel from one chapter to another at tha save points, which are plenty, avoiding in that way having to play over and over a world when you are killed in a difficult, specially boss fight.

As in other RPGs you can do normal or special exclusivelearned attacks for each character, magical attacks or defenses, use your turns to use items to power up or restore health, use leadership to improve attack or defense, you can even skip your turn opr change your character to the 4th party member who is not actively fighting.

You can get items in treasure chests or as rewards for winnning fights.

Upon the recommendation of a friend (who is also a fan) I went ahead and took the plunge... and 150 hours later... boy am I glad I did.  Are there negatives?  Yes!  There really are:  Keyboard and mouse controls are clunky and almost seem backwards at times.  Close quarters combat can be a nightmare because you can hardly see what you are doing because of the ""camera"" design.  Combat in general feels really bad because it's so ""fake"".  The relationships formed with your companions don't feel as intimate as the first 2 Dragon Age releases...

But man... to me... the good things about the game more than make up for the negatives.  There are quests galore that actually have some meaning to them, the storyline (to me) is engrossing and interesting, the different lands are actually really different so you don't feel like you are in the same place all of the time.  The NPCs are almost all completely different in facial features, build and dress (except for soldiers and a few nobles), the music is spell binding, the voice acting throughout is some of the best of any RPG I've ever played (and I've pretty much played them all)... I could go on and on about what I liked about this game.

Is it perfect?  No.  I haven't found one yet that fits that description.  But, for your gaming dollar, if you are a fan of the Dragon Age series, and a fan of RPGs in general you can't let this one pass you by.  Even if you just put it on your wish list for the day when it is in the bargain bin, give it a try.  I don't think you will be disappointed.  Oh, and as for ""bugs"", this game has been patched up and I only experienced one weird ""crash"" (the game just closed immediately for no apparent reason), but I played for 150 hours (not straight of course! lol) with only that one problem.

But Vice City was really really amazing considering when it was launched.  San Andreas was so good I played it from beginning to end twice, which is probably the only game I've ever done that with.

The last version of Grand Theft Auto was a little disappointing for me.  I didn't much like the character and it somehow missed the magic of San Andreas.

Now we have GTA:V and it's stunning.  To me it captures ALL the magic of the best GTA renditions.

There are a bewildering array of weapons, outfits, equipment, and vehicles from aircraft to submarines.

Five stars - Another NES Arcade port, but one of the best!

The original ""Double Dragon"" proved to be quite the hit.  However, it was with the sequel, ""Double Dragon II: The Revenge"", that the series really hit its stride.  The title was released on the following platforms: Arcade, NES, Mega Drive, PC Engine, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Amiga, IBM PC, and TurboGrafx CD.

The game as released as both an arcade title in 1989 and then released on the NES in January 1990.  However, there are so many differences between the NES and the arcade that they are almost two separate games.

The NES version of ""Double Dragon II"" is very different from the Arcade title, featuring cut scenes similar to the famous scenes from ""Ninja Gaiden"", and a changed ending. The levels are drastically redesigned and the NES version features a few enemies not present in the arcade title. ""Double Dragon II"" also features co-op gameplay, something the original NES ""Double Dragon"" lacked.

The plot revolves around Marian, the heroine from the original game, being shot and killed, which sends Billy and Jimmy off on a beat-em-up campaign. The original arcade ending is rather bittersweet, whereas the NES version Mario is raised back to life.

""Double Dragon II: The Revenge"", originally an arcade port,featured several more levels than the arcade title. There are also nine levels total, where the arcade version only has four levels. However, the last level, with its final boss the Mysterious Warrior, is only available on the hardest difficulty setting.  On easy and medium difficultly, the NES version has four more levels than the arcade version

All the original beat `em up moves from the original game are back, along with several new moves.  The co-op game play is probably the best thing about the title though, as it adds a lot more depth.

You can also select ""Mode A"", where when playing co-op your attacks do not hurt the other player.  If you select ""Mode B"", your attacks do hurt the other player.  It's like enabling/disabling friendly fire in a war game.  It's great they made that an option.

Graphically the title is top notch, one of the best looking NES titles out there.  The game almost appears to be 16 bit, although it is limited to the NES color palette. This is due to the game developer, Technos, actually designing and implementing a special coprocessor chip that would improve the graphical power and greatly improve graphic design capabilities on the somewhat [fairly] limited NES hardware.

The video game website IGN rated this title as the 837h greatest game on their top 100 NES games of all time.

(For those looking for great unknown NES/Famicom games, you simply MUST play ""Moon Crystal"", a criminally unknown Famicom exclusive.  The graphics are astounding with cutscenes that even outdo ""Ninja Gaiden"", amazing music, in depth gameplay, and a fantastic storyline.  Absolutely amazing!

5.0,False,"06 12, 2007",A1NZVUZO1P7STV,B0009Z3K9E,Koopa In A Half Shell,"What a great game this one was. I was fortunate enough to pick up an original copy (neither the re-release or the greatest hits version) back when its initial production trickled to a halt. I left the game wrapped for a long time, thinking it would have the FFVII effect and people would be in demand for the game, after hearing how good it was. Unfortunately, the game was re-released to the public, but in a turn of good fortune, Konami decided it was time to make a greatest hits version, forever cursing the retailers of those really ugly game cases with red ""Greatest Hits"" printed all over it.

I have no idea what the other Castlevanias are like (except for Portrait of Ruin, which I eagerly bought after playing Dawn of Sorrow), but if they're anything like this one, then they must all be somewhat good.

For those that don't know what Castlevania is like (and I can imagine the crowd must be few), it's much like the Metroid side-scrollers. If you don't know what Metroid is like, let's just say Castlevania is a wonderful 2D side scrolling active fighting RPG much like Mario and it maintains a level of simplicity that allows you to stick to the game right up until you finish it. The weapon combos that allow for different boosts (such as the gold boost, attack boost, etc.) are to the point, and I don't know what else to say other than that it's a great pick up, both for collective and playing purposes.

Dawn of Sorrow release for $34.99, then fell to $29.99 on its re-release, but I think that had to do with the release of the DS follow-up Portrait of Ruin. You can nab Dawn of Sorrow for a great price of $19.99 at most retailers, although you'll get stuck with a rather ugly case. Either way, it's a really fun game to play and a pleasure to own.","Koopa, Dawn of Happiness After Purchase",1181606400,,,
5.0,True,"01 3, 2017",A34GO192229QFQ,B0186W6QG0,Dan S,"TL;DR version: The keyboard is great.  Colors are bright and smooth.  Cherry MX Browns feel great.  Very robust and durable feeling keyboard & wire. Decent updated software that's quick to learn and powerful.  Best (only right now) keyboard with these features for the price. Recommended.

I almost missed this keyboard as an option and was about to order a Corsair k95 RGB or k70 RGB.  Both were close to what I wanted, but not exactly.  I didn't want the huge footprint of the k95, but I wanted some macro buttons since I do play MMOs sometimes.  I didn't want Razer because of the poor quality control I've heard horror stories about from them, and at the same price they were missing dedicated media controls, something I wanted and had one few macro buttons.  I knew I wanted Cherry MX switches, so no Logitech.  Besides, their Romer G switches feel all mushy to me.  The long and the short of it is that there really isn't a keyboard on the market that ticked all my boxes til this one.  And to find that it sits $60 below all the competition?  Such a winner.

Only major complaint is to G.Skill: Why does the version with Blue switches have to cost $40 more? That's such a rip off.  I had wanted blue switches, but decided it wasn't worth the premium after trying my roommate's keyboard out with browns.  I still sort of wish I did by them, but browns are still a nice typing feel, and I guess slightly less straining due to lower actuation force.

Overall physically, it has good key placement, even for the gaming keys.  They feel natural to reach to, but there's just enough of a gap to where I don't find myself hitting them instead of the end column of the normal keyboard.  The board itself seems very solid from the metal rail running around it, and the thick braided cord is durable feeling and protected a bit by the rail as well.  I didn't think I'd use the mouse cord caddy, but it's actually pretty nice and helps to fight the pull of extra cord off the back of your desk.  The dedicated media controls are nice and on the fly macro recording is super intuitive.  Also, the included wrist rest is nice to have.  The molded texture on the top makes the lack of soft touch plastic much more acceptable and the fact that it attaches to the metal tube like all the other accessories is nice and secure.

The RGB lighting is good and really not that hard to set up.  I disagree with the amount of complaining people have with the software.  I guess G.Skill did an update since some of the early reviews, since things people mentioned specifically aren't a problem anymore.  So that shows G.Skill is working on improving their product.  While it's slightly more involved than clicking once on the effect you want and being done, if your computer ability is above IE and Office only, you're going to be more than capable of setting up simple lighting profiles.  More advanced stuff will take time, but the capabilities of the lighting tool are pretty impressive.  It would have been nice if they included the volume level and ""num lock"" ""caps lock"" and ""scroll lock"" indicators in the RGB scheme instead of static red, but they look okay as is.  Also, just having the volume level there is a nice touch.  Probably could have done with only one row of windows for it as the bottom one is lit and the other two above it just glow a little.",Best Keyboard you can buy,1483401600,5,{'Style:': ' Cherry MX Brown (RGB LED)'},

Once they've created a Sega Genesis version of an infamously crappy NES game, and now they're behind some of the best pinball video games to have ever been developed. Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection, is exactly what it says on the tin: A virtual collection of classic pinball tables from the industry's past, faithfully recreated for play through a Wii disc. I'm not sure this game will change the minds of those that aren't too fond of pinball, but if you're not one of those people, then you're going to find a lot to enjoy!

There are ten beautifully represented tables, each with a unique theme and carefully-crafted layout. While the older cabinets have enough bells and whistles to sprinkle over play, ones made in later years sport their own music, and BOY do these things SCREAM ""nostalgic value""! The presentation as a whole is not really like anything you'd see in another Wii game, as this is composed of pinball tables created before the Super Nintendo was even a thing. It's like the 80s came back or something, you know? There are even background sound effects as you're playing, as if you're really there in an arcade!

You can tell the game is lovingly crafted right down to where the game plays! Using two buttons to control pinball flippers has never felt so satisfying to do (other than using real pinball cabinet buttons of course)! With this and the top-notch physics for the ball onscreen, it feels like I am really in control of the action...until the ball zooms right past the corner areas where you can't protect it from hitting the gutter. It's a traditional pinball thing, so I can't exactly blame this game for it, but the one real issue I have with it is that, well, while I'm all for being faithful to the originals, I feel like the game could've been a bit more generous on the ball saves. Fortunately, there are still your traditional extra balls and the always wildly fun and crazy multiball trigger!

Exclusively for the video game side of things, there are multiple achievements you can obtain by doing specific tasks required on the tables. This is where Credits come to play; the more Credits you earn by accomplishing these goals and obtaining specials, the more opportunities you get for unlocking pinball tables for free-play mode. You can also unlock them by achieving all of the goals on each table. And while this game has enough high-scoring ball bouncing for pinball lovers everywhere, I'm personally the kind of gamer that likes to play through a game to the end, while dabbling in high-scoring when I'm at an actual arcade. That's why I like the inclusion of the Williams Challenge; you play through each of the ten tables by scoring over a set high score for that table (While also setting your own bar if you'd like) to move on to the next until you played them all.

All that said, this is a triple-AAA pinball game that's lovingly crafted for pinball fanatics and even gamers that are willing to dive into the classic genre of arcade cabinets. Definitely give this one a go!",Lives up to its name!,1432857600,,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii'},

The Tom Tom Gang are out for treasure as usual, and in the process find something called The Big Crystal. Benito immediately sets his sights on it, but in the process the crystal cracks, causing a major problem for the Time Sweepers. Their computer system shuts down and the clock has stopped working, causing Time Monsters to appear all over the place, and upsetting the Time Goddesses. Benito begins dreaming of the daughter of the Goddesses, Mina, who begs him to collect all the crystal fragments. Meanwhile the Time Sweepers are also after the crystal fragments, thinking the Tom Tom Gang want them for less than reputable purposes and hoping to repair the crystal themselves. As it turns out, the Goddesses are debating whether or not to drop the Time Scissors (which cut the strings of time), which in turn will destroy the universe and begin it anew. The player must collect all eight crystal fragments and repair the Big Crystal before the Goddesses destroy the world, all while destroying Time Monsters and setting the universe right.

This game is unique in that there is no real antagonist. In Blinx, the Tom Tom's were antagonists, but here they are anti-heroes, stealing and sneaking to make the world right again. The Goddesses themselves are not malevolent; rather, they can't think of any other way to fix the world if the crystal is not fixed, so their best solution is to make a new one.

And, of course, the best feature of all; you play as both a Time Sweeper and Tom Tom, which are completely customizable to your liking! Want your cat to have purple eyes? Long tail, green fur, black jacket? Short pig, moustache, thick calves, striped shirt? It's all up to you! You also pick your team, who will aid you when you face off against the opposite team. They can be equipped with weapons of your choosing, and can be swapped out for better members by completing side quests.

As before, Time Sweepers can use two types of attacks. Their sweepers, which suck up garbage that is then used as projectiles, and time itself. Time can be paused (to take down/get away from enemies or solve puzzles), rewound (to undo things or prevent death), fast forwarded (to jump longer distances at a rapid speed, and also to gain coins through special rings), recorded (to kill special monsters or solve puzzles that require two characters), slowed down (to solve puzzles or avoid getting hit), and retried (which is exactly what it seems; if your Time Sweeper dies, they are given a rewind to a certain point.)

While the Sweepers control time, the Tom Toms control space. They are given the black hole (sucks up the health of nearby enemies), the quantum snare (Tom Toms will pop up out of the ground and hold Sweepers by their legs while you take them out), the hypercloak (makes you invisible; you must move slowly, or the space around you will begin to crackle with energy and Sweepers will detect you), the space bubble (traps all enemies in a large inescapable bubble that you may move freely in and out of), the void trap (enemies are sucked into another dimension), the subspace dive (your Tom Tom dives into an underground space hole and may sneak by Sweepers undetected, but only for so long due to lack of oxygen), and the warp tunnel (your Tom Tom will warp from their current location to a previously unreachable or hard to reach location; very good for carrying heavy bags and sneaking past Sweepers.) Tom Toms also get three gadgets; the decoy (which Sweepers will follow in place of you), the time grenade (the same as the Sweeper's pause control), and bananas (which will cause your enemies to slip and be knocked out for a short amount of time.) In place of the Sweeper's, well, sweepers, the Tom Toms use guns and a slingshot loaded with tranquilizers.

Gameplay is fun, scattered across beautifully detailed levels with all sorts of puzzle games. Some parts are a bit tedious, some parts are just plain difficult, but overall it's very fun. Cat Medals and Pig Medals unlock concept art and funny mini-movies, and side quests unlock things like team members, store items, and new guns/sweepers. Every level is played twice on different paths, once by the Sweepers and once by the Tom Toms. Every level that ends in a boss battle for one of the two will end in a shootout for the other (for example, in the floating castle level, the Sweepers battle a giant Benito monster, while the Tom Toms defeat a team of Sweepers.) If you're looking for a game to play long term, I will admit this isn't it. I've beaten it in one long (and I mean loooooong) sitting before. On the bright side, gameplay is so fun you'll want to beat it over and over again, so you won't be bored!

The only thing; if you're wanting to play as Blinx, you won't. He only appears in cutscenes. You can customize your Sweeper to look like him if you like, but he is a NPC throughout the whole game. You do get to speak to the leaders of some other Sweeper teams though, that's fun to see.",Master time and space! And steal a little for yourself too.,1367884800,3,,

The only problem with them is that they are not easy to apply perfectly on the devices without misalignment, dust or bubbles. Now that Hori has produced a screen protective filter for 3DS, I naturally have to get one for my 3DS.

The 3DS screen protective filter seem to be of the same high quality that I've come to love. What's new is a much easier method of applying the filter. It has two broad sticky tabs on two sides that you can use to affix it to the device after you've aligned the filter to the screen perfectly. Then you just pull the tab on the inner side of the filter to remove the protective film. Since filter has already been aligned and fixed to the device properly, you can easily attach it to the screen and smooth out any bubbles while the position and the alignment is maintained. After that, you just have to remove the outer film to finish off the installation. Repeat the same process to the other screen and you're done.

Although the new application method is much easier, you would still have to follow the instructions carefully. You have to affix the filter carefully around the edge of the device so that the filter can actually lay flat and touch the screen after you remove the protective film. Otherwise, there can be enough wiggling room for the filter to shift out of alignment. A wiping cloth is provided to remove any dusts on the surface of the screen before application.

Overall, I'm very happy with the Hori screen protective filter. It attaches to screen with leaving residues. It's crystal clear without any rainbow effect. It's tough yet does not affect too much the response of the touchscreen.",Best screen protector just getting easier to apply,1308182400,,,

This game goes back in time (hence ""Origins"") what feels like 5-10 years.  It feels like a GREAT compilation of all my favorite Batman things:

Nolan trilogy: The suit looks very similar to the TDK and TDKR suits.  Also, now when he interrogates Riddler goons for information, he growls ""WHEERRRRE IS IT??!"" in the same exact tone as when Bale Batman beat Bane and demanded ""WHEERRE IS THE TRIGGER?""  Overall the character feels very close to the Bale Batman.  Also, when the Batwing parks in the Batcave, it flies through the waterfall and hovers to a stop... just like the Batwing in TDKR.  Also, the Batcave features some old mine cars and a rickety looking old-school elevator that remains me a lot of the one from Batman Begins.

Batman: Year One: It has a young Gordon, obviously, but also includes Year One pillars like bad cop Branden and his crooked SWAT team, who Batman fought in Year One and now the player gets to battle.  It also has Commissioner Loeb.  It also includes some of those great ""learning the ropes"" Batman moments that we enjoyed so much in Batman Begins and Year One.

Batman Returns: Love it or hate it, you have to admit that the second Keaton movie looked great.  I always wanted a free roaming Batman game in which I could swoop through the snow-covered, Christmas-decorated Gotham of ""Returns"" and thought I'd never get it.  The Christmas snow and decor just makes it dang cool.

Non-Complaints:  I read some mediocre reviews of this game and have to say, I *disagree* with the most common complaints:
1) Gotham is too quiet with no civilians.  The story explains this:  It's Christmas Eve with a bad blizzard.  Everyone is at home sleeping.  Okay, so that's the logical explanation.  But even absent that, I have to ask... would the game be way better with a bunch of scripted people walking around the block?  Having played it, it feels like there is more than enough to do.

2) It's the same old thing.  The city is way, way bigger.  The artistic style is very different.  Everything else they kept is the good stuff.  How easy would it have been to use the same old art and Batsuit?  But they reinvented Bats and re-did all of the villains.  It feels like a different game to me: The crooks in Arkham City were always chatting about being in prison.  Here, the city looks different and everyone's up to different stuff.  Also, gone are Riddler question mark trophies.  They are replaced with more realistic ""hard drives"" with data the Riddler will use for extortion.  You still get to solve puzzles and find them everywhere, but they are more realistic.  Not a big change, but it does change it up in a not-terrible way.  It might seem small, but if you were in the same bat suit with the same green question marks, it would probably feel much more derivative.

New additions:
1) Crime scenes / case files:  They are pretty straight forward, but I REALLY appreciate that they at least came up with some sort of detective mechanic so that Batman's not just a ninja who beats up a thousand guys.

2) Bat cave:  It's great.  I love it.

Overall, it's a great game, it's a big game, it's a well-designed game, and it does NOT feel like they phoned in a cheap copy of a sequel.  Even the old parts of Gotham that we saw in Arkham City have received a significant facelift.

5.0,False,"12 21, 2005",A1HX04JEY9MR3,B0009XEC02,C. Bakehorn,"The Advance Wars series is the best handheld strategy series to date. Using a simple interface but complex tactics, Advance Wars has always been a game that the hardest of hardcore or the newest of newbies could pick up and enjoy. Nintendo and Intelligent Systems have managed to bring all of the strategic action to the Nintendo DS in the best way possible, Advance Wars: Dual Strike.

Advance Wars was great, but Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising took everything and made it better. Similarly, Dual Strike is basically AW2 with a lot of new stuff and a continuing story. The Black Hole army was defeated but once again they're trying to recover and gain power. It's up to the Allied Nations of Orange Star, Blue Moon, Yellow Comet, and Green Earth to rise against the Black Hole forces and silence them once and for all. New Commanding Officers come into play and mix up the story, but the old protagonist Andy has been replaced by an annoying new guy named Jake. Jake wouldn't be so bad if he wasn't an Orange version of your typical suburban wannabe...but that's a different story.

The gameplay remains largely intact, with the same turn-based stuff we've all played and loved for four years. Each side gets a turn and the battle cycles around until a headquarters location is captured or all units of one side are destroyed. There are 25 units (which includes six all-knew units) at your disposal, ranging from infantry units to stealth planes. Using different types of terrain for transportation and defense, the goal is to finish each battle with as much success and as few casualties as possible. Every once in a while during the campaign, players are forced to complete missions within a certain number of days or before a missile explodes overhead. These different parameters require for near-perfect strategizing, so progression through the game takes a lot of skill. Capturing different properties is as vital as ever, especially when you factor one of the new properties. Also, using COs and their CO Powers effectively makes things much easier or harder, depending on your skill. As I said, there are several new COs and getting used to their different strengths and weaknesses is going to take a lot of practice.

Some big things that really change the gameplay are the introduction of dual-screen combat as well as tag-team battles with multiple COs. Sometimes it's up to you to win the war on two fronts and defeat an enemy CO while also fighting a completely separate battle at the same time. These matches require a lot of attention and detail because they're essentially two battles in one. Choosing the proper CO for each battle is only the start, because victory or defeat can make or break the whole battle. Fortunately you can control both COs if you wish, but there's an option for AI-controlled COs for newer players. I found myself controlling the other CO myself, because the AI-controlled COs usually went and got themselves killed pretty quickly.

The tag-team battles make up the second half of the game, where you fight a normal battle with two COs. You can switch between the two at any time and take advantage of their capabilities, which makes things interesting. For example, series veteran Max has always been good with tanks but is terrible with indirect units like Rockets and Artillery. If I were getting pounded away by enemy Artillery, I'd probably want to switch Max for another CO so I could counter the enemy without having to get too close. However, if the enemy decided to change its plan and send tanks after me, Max's superior firepower would take care of them with ease. Furthermore, the multiple COs can now unleash what is called a Dual Strike (hence the subtitle in the game's name), where both COs use their CO Powers and attack in the same round. Being attacked with a Dual Strike can ruin an entire battle, but hitting your foes with a Dual Strike gives a much higher chance of winning.

In addition to a 28-mission campaign, there are several other options that deserve credit. Nintendo provides an excellent multiplayer option, allowing up to eight players to wage war using only one cartridge. Also, the War Room mode from the previous games makes a return. New gameplay modes include Survival and Combat. In Survival mode, you are given limited time, funds, or turns and you must finish the battle before that limit is reached. Combat mode is interesting to say the least. It's basically a real-time game where players drive around manually and shoot with the A button. Capturing buildings and destroying units is as simple as before, but you don't take turns doing it. It's not a big enough experience to call a full game, but if anything, it might be interesting to call it a very basic handheld preview of the GameCube's upcoming Battalion Wars.

Something that surprised me was the fact that Dual Strike has good music. Nintendo has never been known to develop the best MIDI handheld tunes, but Advance Wars sounds pretty good. Finally I can play a Nintendo game without turning the music off. The sound effects pack a punch for such a small game, as well. In the graphical department Advance Wars excels with updated graphics from the previous games in the series. The map itself looks similar, but the archaic structures now look a little more modern with a slightly three-dimensional look. The actual cut-scenes through which battles are shown look much better than before. The animation is cleaner, the color is brighter, and the explosions look much more fiery.

I'm just going to come out blunt in conclusion: I love this game. Nintendo and Intelligent Systems have served up three straight strategic masterpieces. The Advance Wars series has always been good, and fans of strategy or the AW series should definitely buy Dual Strike. It's easily the best DS game, and I might go out on a limb to say that it's my favorite strategy game. Advance Wars rocks.",Advance Wars is a blast,1135123200,24,,

I play all of my games in the dark and in the dead of night by default btw. But maybe I was prepared because just before playing this game, I finished Silent Hill Homecoming. I found that game to be much darker, much more oppressive. Dead Space had too much action for me to be really scared. Things jumping out at me can only be scary if it doesn't happen often.

For an average gamer like me, who occasionally dabbles in racing games, the hundreds of dollars needed to get some of that gear is an overkill. I still like to have better control than a standard dualshock gamepad, and amazingly, this racing wheel provides it for the about same price. The wheel itself is solidly built of sturdy plastic, and very well laid out with the paddle up/down shifters and all the action buttons. With the strong clamp, mounting this wheel sturdily should be no problem at all. You can however forget about playing it in your lap, the tension of the bugee mechanism makes that impossible. The wheel is a bit on the small side, and the bungee cord tension mechanism is stiff, but the steering control provided by it far surpasses the dualshock thumbsticks. The pedals are very sturdy as well, and provide a nice amount of control over the gas and braking. They do unfortunately tend to slide around a lot, and I ended up mounting them with velcro. Once I did that, they stayed put. I lucked out, and had an old wooden TV stand laying around that provided the perfect mounting setup for this product. If you don't have something like that, a visit to the local store to pick a cheap one is highly recommended. I also love the programmability that this wheel has. Due to this, it is a much better choice than the Ferrari Universal 5-in-1 Racing Wheel, also by Thrustmaster. That wheel is slightly cheaper, but does not allow you to change much, making it potentially less compatible with games. Spend the few extra bucks, and get this one instead.

I tried and made this wheel work in Burnout Paradise, Gran Turismo 5, and Need for Speed Shift. With the programmable buttons, and the fact that the wheel is detected as a standard PS3 controller, this should work with almost any game. The only thing this wheel can't be programmed to have is the horizontal axis of the right thumb stick, and most racing games (with the exception of Modnation Racers) don't use that axis for anything but camera control.",Best value if you are a casual racing game fan,1295222400,,,

I was skeptical a bit, on this one, but the pirate theme is one that hasn't been done enough in gaming, and the reviews are good, so I hopped on board. Now I can't put it down. Yes, it's pretty much ""AC in the Caribbean"", but the execution is masterful, and the variety of activities is so vast and seamlessly integrated, it's an absolute gem of a game. Treasure hunts, sea battles, exploration, pirate/assassin missions... each feature unique and yet engaging in its own right. When you get tired of killing, .. you can take to the seas .. or explore a new town... or decipher a treasure map.. or hunt for wild animals... or.. you get the idea.

However, I was never quite interested in the whole ""Animus"" angle, that you're actually reliving an historical character through some virtual reality headset, like in the other AC titles. It just doesn't seem necessary to the game and I've never really understood that storyline anyway.

I spent hours online looking for a new keyboard, going so far as into the insanity of Reddit's r/MechanicalKeyboards (mind blown by those sweet nerds). It was difficult to find out simple features of each board out there, having to look into reviews, questions asked/answered, and screenshots. Soooo .... I will list some of the big answers here.
- RBG
- 5 color modes, plus 'lights off'
- you can speed up/down the color wave modes. Some can be reversed
- one mode allows you to custom color individual keys. EACH key can be colored how you want (or unlit)
- multimedia keys are not lit, or clicky mechanical. They're half-size (short, but wide as keys), kind of halfway between key and button
- no extra USB ports on keyboard

I'm new to the modern click switches, so can't really give too much details into blue/red/etc, but I will simply say what others have said about them: They're a bit noisy. Probably not something you want to use if you live or work with other people.

You have to be concerned with all of the micro-management of the original Stronghold. You're opponents are more challenging. One aspect of this game that is very challenging is that most areas are arid (desert) regions, so finding areas to grow food can be difficult. Don't worry, that's what makes it more fun. Resources are scarce and enemies are plentiful and vicious. The Wolf, the Rat, the Pig, and the Snake are all back, along with a few new characters to get on your nerves, in a good way.
For those who may have not played the original, you will want to buy this after you have played Stronghold, or you may be disappointed. You don't have to play the original to appreciate this game but it helps.
For those who are new, the idea is simple: keep your people fed, protected, and happy, and they will serve you well. Build an army, make sure there is enough money in the treasury, keep an eye on your rations, maintain sufficient resources on your stockpile, stock your armory with weapons, and eliminate your enemy. It is a wonderful real-time war game, that requires you to focus on more than war.
The regular one-player story mode has about 50 missions, so it will take you a while to complete that aspect. All of the other modes will keep you occupied if you get bored with that, and if you are totally bored, create your own maps and scenarios.

5.0,False,"06 21, 2010",A3PYITFDZPSKWX,B001SGZL2W,J. Vogt,"This game is everything you could want if you ever wanted to experience a Western. A deep story, great setting and nice characters. The game is your typical ""Sandbox"" style game which means they drop you into an area and you basically can do whatever you want, with some consequences. As John Marston, you have to help or rob them. The basic game revolves around you riding around doing quests and other things. It is extremely similar to Grand Theft Auto in that you grab a horse and ahead out to do storyline missions to advance the plot. Their are random encounters along the way, gang hideouts you can do like ""dungeons."" Their are also lots of missions where you have to round up cattle, break in horses and many other things. The game auto aims your gun for the most part so if you don't like shooters have no fear, you can also turn this off if you want to for a more shooter style experience. Their is so much to this game its hard to write it all down, but trust me, you will enjoy it.

Multiplayer wise its pretty good as well. You are dropped in an open map and wander around killing bad guys and gathering plants for xp. Their are objectives and challenges and other players can ""posse"" up with you to have a group going. Their are also standalone death matches for solo play and team play, and again these auto aim so their good for people who don't like shooters. As you gain XP you unlock more outfits and horses as well as titles.

The downsides to this game are pretty rare but they do exists. Their are graphically glitches constantly. People will disappear and will become a floating gun or broomstick that is actually kinda funny. Sometimes after completing a quest the game will lock up on a loading screen and you cant do anything. If you accidentally wander into a quest area you may be forced to complete that quest even if its out of order or the game will not let you continue at all.

Overall I love this game. It is a great experience for anyone who wants to do anything from the old west or is just looking for a good open game. I finished the main game and all side quests and challenges in around 50 hours for those of you looking for a time line.

5.0,False,"03 22, 2017",A224K23RBRSR2A,B01GW3NY5Q,Wise Owl,"The only negatives I have found in this game so far are it has terrible character customization. I don't understand how they could take such a huge step backwards and the presets are ugly. The beginning of the game is pretty weak and uninteresting, but once you get your own ship and start exploring it really picks up in every aspect.  Let's also get the most idiotic complaint that has been blown way out of proportion out of the way. Yes there are a few times and I mean only a few times you will see really bad facial animations, but most of them are pretty much normal run of the mill facial animations. I play a lot of games and I can't think of any non cgi facial animations that are all that great. Every game I have ever played with facial animations has had moments where they look bad. People are being overly harsh and are going into the game basing it off what they heard and entering the game with a negative opinion right out of the gate.

Once you get your own ship it really starts feeling like a Mass Effect game exploring solar systems and planets. The story is actually pretty good as well. You also finally start meeting interesting characters. I can certainly understand all the negativity for the beginning of the game, but push past it and discover what is actually a pretty great game. I think I would put it somewhere between 2 & 3 which where my favorites in the series. It's way better than the first game.

The graphics are not best I've seen, but they are the best in the series and the game is still beautiful to look at. There tons of different weapons and armor all with unique bonuses and upgrade options. They can all be customized to your liking and I am rocking some pretty snazzy custom colored armor. The combat is about what you would expect from a Mass Effect game with some improvements to the overall feel of combat. The character interactions are about the same as the rest of the series as well.

Overall it doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it makes some improvements and gives you more freedom to explore and complete the game at your own pace. I have spent about 15 hours so I am not that far, but I couldn't stand all these negative reviews complaining about the facial animations or other technical glitches (of which I have encountered non so far).

I hadn't played Halo 3 in months because I was bored with it. There's a lot of content here and I'm glad to say this game is worth every penny of $60 and I've been very entertained. Yes, it's still Halo and ""more of the same"", but they've changed enough about it to make a new Halo experience, not just another rehash. ODST was a joke of a game compared to Reach and having owned it almost made me skip out on Reach.

The campaign spoilers will go at the bottom of the review.

I'll put in some of the major stuff I've noticed but I'm sure I'll miss a lot.

There's a new graphics engine and the graphics in the game are superior to any other 4 player split screen game I've played, and I make a special effort to purchase as many of them as I can. The graphics are certainly not Killzone 2 level, but very high quality. MUCH better than Halo 3. I was very pleased when I played the BETA that the new engine still plays in HD when doing split-screen and that it's split horizontally. The blood and shield effects are very well done. You have a night vision mode instead of a flashlight now, similar to ODST. The sound effects are pretty darn good. They finally made the sound of a grenade somewhat deafening. The music, as usual, is very well done and adds a lot to the experience.

The new engineering packs have really added to the game and are what really makes Reach a different experience. Your options that you'll find in the campaign are sprint, hologram, bubble shield(that also heals you), cloaking that doesn't work well if you're moving quickly, what I'd call an ostrich or turtle shield that turns you invincible but immobile and unable to attack and a jetpack. My personal favorites are the bubble shield and the hologram. The Covenant have a roll instead of a sprint in multiplayer.

The enemies are much more mobile and capable of dodging than they were in the past. I beat it on heroic and found the game to be more difficult than the past games, but certainly manageable. The Covenant have engineering packs too. They use the roll very well. There are a couple of new enemies/variations that make the game a little more diverse, but for the most part you've encountered most of them before.

There are new weapons. There is no dual wielding. Both factions have weapons that are very similar now, I suppose it made balancing the game easy. All the weapons seem more effective than they were in the past (probably explains why there is no dual-wielding). The particle beam gun is pretty neat as is the covenant grenade launcher. The rocket launcher can lock onto vehicles. There are some of the old goodies, but there's a new covenant needler battle rifle, a covenant multi-lock plasma/rocket launcher and a couple of other new guns. The battle rifle is single fire instead of burst. There's the awesome pistol from the original Halo. There are two animations in how you melee something when you're holding a weapon. You can also backstab/knife someone now and it shows a little cinematic of you letting them have it instead of them just dying in with an ordinary hit.

There's a health-bar under your shields like HALO 1. There's no red screen when you're injured either, just a red bar. This is a huge plus for me. It's the perfect system.
Customizable characters are a great addition. You get credits for every kill you make, and you can use those credits to make your character look different. New helmets, new kneepads, new add-ons etc. It's a great way to make people feel like they have a real in-game Avatar. As far as I know there are no benefits combat-wise to having new armor, it's just visual. This is how I like it. In Call of Duty games you have to play the game for quite a while to unlock all the weapons and upgrades and it gives experienced players an unfair advantage online. In Reach you should always have a level playing field, you'll just look spiffy if you play a lot. Your customized appearance is in the campaign and multi-player, even the cutscense as they're rendered.

Vehicles. The ghost has been nerfed. It was my favorite vehicle. I got a 27 kill spree on one in Halo 3 so I'm disappointed. The invincibility power ruins running people over. The guns on it are not all that effective either. There's a mini wraith vehicle that is pretty awesome, it can carry other people too. There's a missile launcher mounted to a Warthog also. The humans have the VTOL aircraft with side gunners again.

Multiplayer is where this game really shines. No games does online split screen shooter as well has HALO. The engineering packs/loadouts add a new dimension to the game. Sprint and roll makes the game much faster than it used to be. Not every game mode makes use of the loadouts so if you're a purist you've still got options. Some of the packs don't seem too effective on some game types but sometimes it's fun to just mess around. There's an invasion mode where you play Covenant VS NSDF and try and capture objectives. It's a lot of fun and a great new challenge. There are 3 more classes available with different engineering packs. I also played some firefight (like ODST, but with some new modes) and it was great fun. You can put a human player on the covenant side to make it even more challenging.
HUGE NEGATIVE: No 4 player split screen in Big Team Battle, the Campaign, or Firefight. I expected this for the last two, but Big Team Battle has always had this option. 3 or 4 players split-screen Big Team Battle was what I'd do 90% of the time I've ever played Halo. It probably didn't run very well with the new engine, and that's unfortunate. Taking this away from the game took away A LOT of value for me. I should remove a star but there are still a variety of other options for you to play. I still think the game deserves 5 stars but the loss of 4 player split screen Big Team Battle really hurts the game's playability as a ""party game"".

Negative: DLC. I was a fan of DLC until Bungie/MSFT disabled some game modes on my original copy of Halo 3 because I didn't want to buy their overpriced map packs. That's shameful. Charging $5+ for 3 maps is shameful. This game might be great now but once they release a couple of map packs the price of playing the full game goes up and up and up. If I lose game modes I'm dropping this review to 1 star. Matchmaking doesn't have much variety. There are more maps than what the playlist is using over and over. Of course the game could use some more maps but I'm not willing to pay much for more of them considering how easy it is for them to make a map with the included editor. Many of the multiplayer maps are in the campaign anyways.

Negative: The double punch in multiplayer, it's not as easy as it was in the beta but it's still how you'll die about half the time. I actually like it but I know it'll annoy a lot of people as sometimes not firing your gun at all is the best strategy.

Negative: Matchmaking still doesn't work perfectly, but the option to vote for different game types/modes makes it a lot more enjoyable.

Negative: In invasion mode the humans seem to win the majority of the time. This may or may not be because of their weapons loadout. The assault rifle is easier to use as the shots hit instantaneously and you don't have to lead your target like you would with the plasma gun.",second best game in the series behind the first,1297814400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

You can be always online and have other players in your game session to race with or race against. You can also utilize other players to take on Police who are trying to bust you. You unlock your cars as you go through the story, which you can then purchase with points you earn from accomplishing different events(Hot Pursuits, Races, Time Trials). The thing I like the most is the upgrade system. If your favorite car is lacking on certain stats you can spend time putting points towards that cars stats(Durability, strength, top speed, acceleration, etc...) Also you can purchase weapons for your cars to use during your open world journey. There is also a completely different experience when you play as the police, who also have their own set of cars to unlock and upgrade. You will spend plenty of time with this game if you have a taste for fast paced racing!!",Best NFS in many years,1407715200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

(if you are looking for a comparison between the G9 and G9x there is one between those reviews)

the mouse is awesome, you get the response you can expect from a gaming mouse. the precision is really great. I didn't have any problem installing the the software or configuring the profiles I wanted, also choosing colors for the LED on top is relatively straight-forward. The ability to choose your profiles and even set them to be turned on automatically or manually is a great addition. Because I grew tired of flipping the mouse over every time I am about to play one of my games.

The mouse also comes with a number of weights so you can choose to have either a heavy G9x or a light one. I set it to around around 19 grams, which I felt is just right for me. Also having to sets of mouse graps (or case) is pretty damn nice, one is soft for more action games, and rough for games that requires firm grip on the mouse such as red alert 3 where you have to keep your hand on the mouse all the time, or at least thats what I do.

The mouse also has an option to skip the nudges in the mouse wheel, this can be very useful in certain games, I have tried it in switching weapons in borderlands and it works as a charm, but you have to be careful otherwise you will skip two or more weapons at a time. I usually keep the nudges on so to help me narrow down how many weapons or items I want to skip to reach my intended one. but when surfing the net especially ones with long articles, it is good to be able to reach the bottom of a 30 pages site in less than a second.

The mouse also has two buttons on the sides which I am starting to use regularly, they are set to go back and forth in browsing the net or windows explorer. however the mouse gives you the ability to customize all the buttons associated with any profile, and with a built in memory it is easy to carry it around with all your profiles stored and just burge at your friends in the entertainment centre with a G9x in your hand just so you can see the looks in their faces. But don't do that if you are a newbie, you will be the joke of the year.

The wheel also has the feature of side scrolling though it doesn't work all the time, apparently the software or the browser you are using has to support this function which is a shame that most of them dont.

What I wanted to do was point out how great the game is as stand alone title instead of focusing on the fact it has ""Tales"" in it's title.

I honestly must say that some gameplay in the game is shallow, like the cooking which I never actually used. The game though has a lot to offer which I want to sum up in my short review.

The graphics are extremely inviting and colorful. I love this in Role Playing Games. Exploring towns was a real treat especially with an outstanding soundtrack to follow it. The composer really created the perfect combination of techno and orchestra music together to make a vibrant and excellent soundtrack. The composer even threw in a good deal of Jazz which really compliments the situations it's used in. I personally have a large interest in Anime and get really relaxed when I get to sit down and watch a great one like Trigun, CowBoy Bebop, etc, so exploring the towns, environments and the great humor of this game was a real treat.

I don't have a lot of time in my day. I am married and I have a 3-month-old son. Sitting down and demanding an RPG that requires me to invest hours and hours into it with a slow evolving story just doesn't work for me anymore. This game moved fast and kept my interest for the 5 minutes to the 2 hours I could afford to play it during my weekdays. My Wife even loves to sit down and play it. I think the fact that it is has a bit shallower gameplay than the average or above average RPG fanatic enjoys makes this game really appeal to people with a full schedule. I enjoyed the perfect mix of gameplay, customization and story development and would recommend it for ANYONE that is looking for a great way to pass the time and put a smile on their face.

With the great graphics and graphic style, the excellent soundtrack (btw the customer submitted picture that mentions that the music is cool in that area; that song is called ""The Bird Chirps, I Sing"" by an artist named: Kanon) and fun and funny (despite being a bit generic, which is sometimes half the fun) story I cant really say that these reviews that point out the bad are doing the good any justice.

The best thing I love about the game is when things get too difficult for him, I can have him climb on my back and he is content on watching himself still complete the levels. I also have the choice of playing 1 or 2 player at anytime, and can keep switching back and forth, to the same world screen. In many cases, I will go ahead and unlock 1 or 2 worlds while he is sleeping as 1 player since Diddy automatically stays on my back even in 1 player mode. Each character has their own special moves. Donkey kong has his same lovable traits and Diddy is able to shoot peanuts out of his gun and has a rocket on his back for extra jumping hang time that even works when he is on Donkey Kong's Back. They both have new blowing, rolling, and shaking options that are needed to complete some of the more difficult lessons. Although some of the lessons are a challenge, it is not too much to puzzle solve with my prechooler, even if it takes me 6-7 times to figure out what needs to be done with each end world ""monster"". For the first time, my son is learning and practing patience;) He also really has alot of fun when I leave it up to him to pick out differences in the ground and screen for a chance at bounus rounds, He is better than me to pick out the banana bunches that need to be shaked to recieve more bananas (at 100 you get another life), coins (used to buy health, lives or extra's at the store), or bonus K -O -N-G & puzzle pieces bonuses.

Not as deep as NWN, yet the story engaged you enough to make it more than a hack'n'slash. Not as dark as DIABLO II, yet blood fever will take hold of you once in battle. A number of innovative ideas made DUNGEON SIEGE a unique experience: the cinematic perspective, the original characters (machine-gun shooting medieval robots!), the fighting-back pack-mule...
At the same time, both the enemies' and your company members' AI is well above par.

Graphically, this is a 4 year game yet it plays much smoother and it has further horizons than most cRPGs today. Even if, to any true cRPG fun, graphics is not everything (otherwise DAWN OF MAGIC would have been considered a great game), DUNGEON SIEGE is found wanting in nothing when it comes to graphics. Not until TITAN QUEST got released could any cRPG hold a candle to DUNGEON SIEGE! Tress and grass move as you pass by, water ripples as you step into it and wakes as you walk through it. Everything worn or wielded appears on the character; whereas, magic spells are not shabby at all.

The game also sports a GREAT CAMERA PLACEMENT (zoom capable and totally customizable) and has one of the BEST SOUNDTRACKS - the theme music will stay with you as the appropriate theme for any epic battles in the future.

Those of you who were (rightfully) disappointed with the truly bad and much shorter DUNGEON SIEGE 2 (I still cannot fathom how they managed to botch that one!), keep in mind that it has only skin-deep similarities to its predecessor. This is the one to buy!

5.0,True,"10 15, 2007",A23314SLHPAHAM,B000NVKZ06,Rorke Haining,"I'm a middle-aged man with plenty of game-playing experience of all types of games, but, I've never played a Harvest Moon game before.  I review from this perspective.

This is an excellent, highly addictive RPG/farming simulation.  If you like RPGs but are dubious that a ""farming simulation"" could be fun -- get this game.  Your only regret will be that you spend way too much time playing it!  It's a cross between Dark Cloud and Animal Crossing.

I've been waiting for a good RPG on the DS for some time now.  I did not feel that Etrian Odyssey was very good but played it anyway for lack of a more compelling alternative.  Now there are 2 excellent RPGs for the DS (Rune Factory + Zelda: Phantom Hourglass).  I know that Z:PH will be a breakaway hit and a much better game, but RF is so fun and so addictive that I simply can't put it down until I've achieved all that I want to achieve in it.

I won't go into detail to describe Rune Factory, as you can no doubt get that information in many reviews and other sources.  Suffice it to say that there's a wealth of things to do:  explore caves, mine minerals, smith weapons, court young women, tame monsters, fish, cook, upgrade your house, etc. etc..  And, of course, there's lots of farming.  It's very compelling to have so many different avenues for growth and improvement.  I suppose I have a mildly compulsive personality, and games like this certainly bring it out.  I want to do it all, so my games tend to last 2-10 times longer than those of other players.  You can do all the parts you want to do and skip the parts you don't like.

Rune Factory is a (mostly) non-linear game without a lot of hints or required goals.  Of course, there is a concept of ""winning"" the game, but if you're like me, most of the goals you'll achieve in this game are the ones you've set for yourself.  I do wish there were some sort of checklist, though.  Most games with ""gotta have 'em all"" aspects provide a checklist of difficult goals to achieve -- e.g. get all the heart pieces in Zelda or unlock all the characters in a fighting game.  Rune Factory does provide you with some lists, but many of the goals I'm pursuing aren't tracked by the game (e.g. tame one of each type of monster, and max out all seed levels without using the wireless connection).  But this is a minor quibble.

The game is hardly perfect, and I considered rating it only 4 stars.  In particular, I'm frustrated by the inconsistent use of inventory management.  Some inventory screens are arranged horizontally, others are arranged vertically, which makes it very hard to find your items.  Some inventory panels show you details of selected items, some don't.  Some close with the B button, others close with the start button.  I really wish the game would segregate dispensable goods from indispensable tools -- why are they stored together?  And there are many other annoyances (e.g. the game allows you to commit very serious mistakes like dropping important items, but, on the flip side, you can't sell or even drop lame spell books) and a few noticeable bugs.

But, bottom line, I enjoy this game far, far too much to consider rating it less than the full 5 stars.  It's one of the best DS titles I've ever played.  If you can only buy one RPG for the DS, based on past performance of other Zelda games, I'd reluctantly steer you to Zelda:  Phantom Hourglass.  But if you like RPGs and can handle getting two, get Rune Factory, you won't be disappointed.","Great, open-ended RPG for ""checklisters""",1192406400,92,,

An amazing in-depth sci-fi role playing game that combines both in game decisions, and First Person shooter aspects.  The game is more ideal i think for the Role Playing game fan rather then just the straight run and gunner type.  There are a variety of classes to select at the character creation screen each with their own strengths, and weaknesses.  You can choose the male or female base for your character, and do a little customizing on the features, and the viola, you're ready to go!  If like me you cut your teeth on BioWare's other golden game Star Wars: The Knights of the Old Republic for the original Xbox.  I guess they decided to jump into the pool fully dressed and emerged with their own franchise, and it's a winner all the way.
  Follow your hero known as Commander Shepherd as he or she tries to save the universe from the Reapers with a collection of aliens by his side.  You go about the game recruiting your crew, and building relationships with them.  You explore this wide and colorful universe around you in your search to stop the villainous Saren from unleashing the Reapers on humanity.
  There are many options on how to play even if you want to be a true Paragon of heroics or a more roguish Renegade with dialogue cues to match your playing style.  With that little inclusion you can enjoy multiple playthroughs and see what happens when you alter your choices.
  I'm such a fan that i could just go on and on about visiting other planets stopping the evil agents of Cerberus, and romancing members of your team but then that would take away from YOUR experience.  Trust me.  If you're a fan of sci-fi games, and you like to really be immersed in your game play and you don't have time for WoW or BioWare's new baby the MMO Knights of the Old Republic then THIS is an excellent substitute for you.  Then as soon as you're done you can rush out and pick up the sequel Mass Effect 2!!!!  Pre-order the collector's edition of ME3, and you won't get disappointed as they go really fast.

5.0,False,"11 25, 2005",A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B000B6ML0U,Lisa Shea,"Perfect Dark Zero is one of my favorite release titles for the XBox 360. The graphics are gorgeous, the main character (female!) has personality, and it's a good combo of shooting, stealth and puzzle solving.

We've been of course testing all of the release titles, but we keep coming back to Perfect Dark Zero just for sheer fun of gameplay.

First, the basic mission tree. You are Joanna Dark, daughter of a bounty hunter who follows in her father's footsteps. You're athletic, nimble, smart, and maybe a bit fool-hardy. The game is set in the future (Joanna was born in the year 2000) and you get an interesting mix of locales to explore as you take on your assignments.

The graphics in this game are simply GORGEOUS, as you might expect from the XBox 360. I highly recommend you play this on a HD TV - I've done screenshots comparing HD to low-def and the difference is rather impressive. The water ripples, the light plays off the rippling water, the rippling water reflects on the textured brick wall, you name it. You get red and blue lights shining down from the ceiling and the lights color their surroundings and even combine where they cross.

There are of course some amusing issues - this still isn't photo-realism of course. There are times that a red laser beam has slight ""ripples"" in it, for example. Still, the quality is far better than anything else on the market.

I suppose you could complain that Joanna goes running around in high-heeled boots and low-cut pants, but heck, I was impressed that her chest size was reasonably normal. Compared to most other video games out there, with their mostly-naked women with inflato-boobs, Joanna is quite demure!

The sound is aiming for a James Bond feel here. I think that is pretty clear from the intro credits. You get a boppy rock soundtrack through much of the game. The dialogue is reasonably well done, and you can't really say much about how gunshots sound. They sound like gunshots.

Gameplay is a mix between Splinter Cell and a FPS. There are times that being stealthy and quiet really pay off. There are other times that just running fast and blasting away will work. There are cool lockpick puzzles, too. I do get frustrated that you can't ""jump"" though. I'll see a nice, inviting open window at less than waist high, and I have to walk right by.

I have mixed feelings about co-op mode. On one hand it's fun to have two females working side by side and taking out the enemy. On the other hand, if one person decides to quit, it shuts down the whole mission. I really like it on other games where a person can pop in and out as necessary. This especially is helpful if a less experienced gamer is stuck and needs help just for a short while.

There's also deathmatch style gaming available, both on local gameplay and XBox Live. This lets you sneak around and head-shot your enemies with great glee.

We've played this for many hours and haven't noticed any problems with lag or crashing. There are certain moves that don't happen instantly - for example, when you shoot from cover, you have to wait for Joanna to ""rise from a crouch"" before she fires. This is quite realistic. The game also has cinematic sequences when things go into a Matrix-like slo-mo which seems to be in many current movies.

If you play this game on easy mode, you can probably zip through all the missions in a single very long gaming session (say 14-16 hours). The harder levels of difficulty are of course more challenging. Really, though, all single-player gameplay is is just a training mode to help you prepare for live gameplay. Once you've gotten your skills sharpened on the computer players, prepare to take on the real challenge, with real live opponents!

Highly recommended.","Great Graphics, Great Lead Character, Fun Gameplay",1132876800,69,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",
5.0,False,"03 6, 2008",A1ZMCD0RCRI3U2,B000ZJVDA2,R. Francis,"Ah, immortality. The fantasy and desire to live forever is as old as death itself. Books, movies, even religion have all been influenced by humanity's desire to exist beyond a normal lifespan; to see the rise and fall of nations, to witness the advancement of the human race, or simply to dance on your enemy's grave. Even Queen wrote a song about it (see the title?)
Lost Odyssey, however, takes a bit more somber approach to agelessness. Sure, you out-live your enemies, but you also outlive your friends, lovers, even your children. What is immortality then, except watching the endless procession of death with no attainable end in sight? We've all played with the idea in our heads at one point or another, but after reading some of the well written memories that the main character, Kaim, recollects, it becomes easy to see that immortality can really be a downer. Even my roommate, who is as jaded, narcissistic, and cold-hearted as they come, admits that some of the memories are real tear-jerkers. I've read some that bemoan the dramatic writing as melodramatic, and it is true that some of the memories can run a bit long, but they're written that way to invoke a clear picture of the events to the reader. But enough about the memories; while they play a significant role in the portrayal of a less than grand millennium of existence, they're not the meat and potatoes of the game itself.
When I first opened the box I was excited that it took an entire four disks to contain it. Reviewers out there say it is because the world is so big, but that's not really the case. The world itself is average size for a next-gen game, and can be contained on one disk. Really, what would be the point of making a video game world so big that you need to change disks just to traverse it? The first three disks are by-and-large filled with cinematics and cut-scenes. You really don't start exploring the entire world till you get to the fourth and final disk. Until then you're watching a 40 hour long movie with the occasional fighting mixed in to remind you that you're playing a game. While others might complain that there isn't enough fighting in the game, I was happy with it. I don't play role playing games to fight a bunch of random encounters; I play for the story. Get an action game if you want to spend the entire time button mashing.
Overall, Lost Odyssey is a superb RPG that is both nostalgic and fresh enough to keep any fan of the genre happy for weeks. Beautifully drawn characters and maps for those of us that eat up graphics, along with deep playability will keep you glued to your television for hours on end. Just remember to take a break every now-and-then to live your life; it's not like you're gonna be around forever.

Voltaire,"All the depressed reviews are either from people who are very intimate with the Conflict series or expected this game to be another COD4.  I personally do not own any of the previous Conflict games so went into this without any expectations and was very pleasantly surprised.  It's a really fun game with an interesting concept: the 2-man team (played by you, the 1-man team) allows you to switch back and forth between sniper Graves and heavy gunner Lang, this means you can be in 2 places at once and therefore complete multiple tasks, use different weapons, split the team for strategy, heal each other...  But since you're part of a team you can command your partner to go in and clear a room or an area and therefore taking all the flak, or you could both go into an area together in the same tank or APC...  Lots of combinations can be done from just a 2-man team.

As far as action there are lots of blow-them-up scenes as the levels are highly destructable.  The rooms are usually filled with flammable containers so shooting one will light up 1/2 the building.  Anything and everything from computers servers, chairs to tables, bulldozers to water towers and anything in between can be destroyed.  Your arsenal isn't huge because you're limited to what you can carry on you at all times but Lang is definitely packing some blow-them-up heat.  Graves on the other hand is the night-time silent ghost killer with scoped sniper rifle.  The dialogues between Graves and Lang (M-rated) are hilarious and makes this game ever better: when Lang heals graves he says ""You ain't dying here redneck"" vs ""You tired of life rookie?"" from Graves.  Lang also says ""I'm freezing my black a$$ off"" in the Siberia mission.  Just some freaking hilarious dialogues (or monologues) between these 2.

There are some not-so-good things about this game though such as the levels being repetitive.  Your special ops team is sent all over the world from icy Siberia to sweltering Venezuela but the missions are pretty much the same: drop in, retrieve, destroy, extract.  There really isn't continuity from one mission to another except for the storyline.  Also, your partner's AI is okay, sometimes he's a great partner and will clear an area but other times he'll stand around while you're getting lit up like a Christmas tree.  Yet other times he'll go in gung-ho all by himself and get lit up like a Christmas tree which then means you'll have to risk your neck to go and heal him which leads to you're getting lit up...  You get the idea.

5.0,True,"09 4, 2014",A3LNU3T5H9OMWC,B00KWFY04A,P. Romance,"Professor Layton and Phoenix Wright both found a mysterious book that transports them to a medieval world full of magic and witches.  But when innocent women were tried as witches and sentenced to death by fire, Layton and Phoenix must combine their talents and skills to save their friends and reveal the truth behind the town.

I'm in total heaven.  When two of my favorite games join forces, I cannot but give a fangirl's squeal of delight.  This is a dream come true.  The plot was amazing.  When compared with recent Layton's games, this story went above and beyond.  The mystery was well hidden right up till the end.  It had a delicious twist that will keep you glued to your 3DS.  I barely put this game down since I got it.  The ending was beautifully done.  Parents should not worry about the content at all.

There was a nice balance of puzzle solving and trials.  Here is the break down:
Layton's Puzzle Solving - There were 70 in-game puzzles.  The puzzles' design remained the same.  Actually, the puzzles were pretty simple and has less room for failure.  I probably needed help with about 10.  So be forewarn, it might not be a challenge.
Ace Attorney's Trials - Trials were always a problem for me.  I can be counted on to mess up a few contradictions.  If you are not familiar with Ace Attorney, you are a defender who has to get a 'not guilty' verdict for their client.  You used evidence and information to contradict witnesses.  If you are familiar, you'll going to love this version.  In this medieval world, magic exist and witnesses change their testimonies on the fly.  So logic didn't always work.  And you were not just dealing with one witness, you were sometimes dealing with 3-10 witnesses at the same time!

The designs were a nice mixture of Layton's and Ace Attorney's.  The maps were easier to move around and finding hint coins and puzzles became easier. The 3D conversion and the graphics just kept improving from the previous Layton games.  Their mouth movements matched their words perfectly and the lines and movements were smooth and seamless.  And the fact that you get to see Phoenix and Maya as 3D characters was awesome.  The voice acting was perfectly cast.  Happily, the original voice actors returned as their perspective characters.  However, there were a lot of scenes where they don't talk.  Reading is a must.

There were not any extra things to do during the playthrough.  However, after you complete the game there will be a bonus of 12 episodes that will tell you what happened to the characters after the events.  These are DLC and one episode is available a day.  It's possible to get two.

It took about 20 hours to finish the game.  I sincerely hope there will be a sequel.  The combination of the puzzle solving and trials made this a very entertaining game.  I honestly would not change a thing.  Except I wished it was longer.  So, Layton and Ace Attorney fans, get this game NOW!",No Objection!  Only Squeals of Delight.,1409788800,,,

If you haven't already played it I would highly recommend you do, for two reasons. The first of course being like I stated above and second, if you plan on playing the sequel playing the first would make that experience so much better. However, not having played the first isn't necessarily a deal breaker; there is an option to watch a short video clip that sums things up from what happened the first time around.

Dead Space 2 hits the ground running, from the moment you have control of Isaac you're fighting to survive and of course jumping from fright. This game starts off right where the first left off in regard to the story, plot wise three years after the first ended to be exact. The story is interesting and adds to the Dead Space timeline seamlessly. The story draws you in, keeps you engaged and then scares the poop out of you.

The controls pretty much mirror the first, with a few added modifications. This is another area where playing the first would be beneficial, because there's not really much of a tutorial, there's a few prompts giving direction as you progress through the game. Also the in game features like the workbench, store, save stations and weapons are all introduced to you as with the assumption you're already familiar with them.

Graphically the game is gorgeous, the environments, the creatures and the settings are all beautiful. My only complaint with the graphics would be the human characters; some of them look like last gen.

Where Dead Space shines the most, is in the special effects and music area. This is what set the tune (pardon the pun) for the first and yet again they succeeded in doing the same for the sequel.

This time around they have added multiplayer to the mix, which is a unique experience to say the least but not the reason to buy this game. It's a nice addition but honestly I don't know if it would pull me away from the many other online games I'm currently playing.

Over all great game, however just as the title reads, play the original first.

I wasn't even going to purchase this game when it came out but a friend of mine who was playing warcraft with me jumped ships and told me that it was a must.  so i gave it a shot.

i fell in love with this game and purchased the collector's edition from amazon.com

since this is a review for that collector's edition i'll do a real quick review of the game:

graphics: 9/10 it's alittle choppy at distance but this is a newly launched MMO so yeah, but up close, the environments and the buildings are absolutely incredible.  if you like dark and gritty and tired of WoW's colorful and gitty, this is where it's at.  this game absolutely puts WoW to shame.

controls: 10/10 you can customize the interface on this game WITHOUT an add on or mod (goodbye Xperl!!) that on top of being able to FULLY customize the controls i don't know how you couldn't give this a 10

story: 10/10 not alot of people pay attention to the story but when and if you do, keep in mind that Warhammer has been around since 1983, they've got a HUGE story for all you story fans

gameplay:  9/10 PVE is just like WoW, but this game has something WoW can't do right:  PVP and RVR, you have to truly experience this to know what it's like but basically once you reach the higher levels, you have to take down the head guy of the other faction and yes, lay siege to their stronghold.  it's like can you take down Thrall or Tyrande Whisperwind?  no, face it you can't, so what's the point in their existence, WAR put's you in their world and makes you feel like you're a part of something.

now on to the collector's edition:

this thing is bigger than it looks.  it's close to 2ft long and 1 foot thick.  it comes with a nice art book that is good sized and HARDCOVER.  it also comes with a full color, full sized HARDCOVER graphic novel.  the game itself is different from the regular edition (i own both).  it comes in a thicker case, has different art on the discs and also has TONS of extra content, it's almost like a totally different game!  you also get a minature of the greenskins leaders, unpainted, plus mine came broken :(  but i kept it in the package so it should be fine.  is the collector's edition worth it?  yes.  why?  because of the extra content on the discs if not of the graphic novel and artbook.",Best MMORPG???,1223251200,,"{'Edition:': "" Collector's"", 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

First off, yes, it is a bit stiff to fit into the case. You have to squeeze the Go inbetween two tabs that hold it in place. But, it's not too bad because if you can manage to spread the tabs a bit while sliding the PSP in, it works out easier. You do have to watch the switches on each side of the PSP because usually the switches will grab onto the tabs and turn your wifi on or switch your psp on while doing it. However, this is only a one time thing. This case isn't like primitive style cases that you are going to constantly take it in and out of. It holds the Go very firmly in place, even with the screen slid up.

I travel a lot and this case is perfect. Even if I didn't travel, this case is still in my opinion the best out there. First, with other cases, you have to take the PSP out and have the now empty case sitting in your lap or somewhere around you. With this case, you just flip open the cover and slide your screen up to start playing. You play with the case still on. When you are finished, you just slide your screen down and close the lid.

Another thing I love about the case is that I don't have to remove the PSP from the case to charge it or when I hook it up to the computer. This case is designed so that it is less like a traditional 'case' and more like a part of the Go itself.

The inside is a smooth felt type material. Real soft and don't worry about scratching. The outside is a leather type materal (don't know if it's real leather or faux leather). The case looks really good on the Go and I don't mind pulling this out in public. The whole case is a hard type, the only flexible part is the 'hinge' that connects the back and front, and the velcro strap that holds it closed is also flexible.

The only *minor* gripe I have with it is that it is a bit awkward to adjust the volume with the screen open. You have to slide your finger between the case hinge and the PSP screen to adjust the volume. It's do-able, and not too bad, so only a minor complaint.

5.0,False,"11 30, 2013",A34VRVI4CSI5RQ,B00DDQ4AZY,Matt Morgan,"I have numerous pairs of higher-end headphones but up to this point I have had no gaming headsets, so I was not entirely sure what to expect with the CM Storm Pulse-R headset. I have a teenage son who plays cooperative games on-line with a friend of his and so I let him use them for that purpose. It took very little time for these to show their strengths.

The first thing we noticed with them is that they are very comfortable. The padding is soft and the cans fit over the ear so there is no pressure on the ear itself. They can be worn for a good period of time without fatigue. The shape of the headphones themselves looks a little odd and as such I was a little concerned that the fit would be off, but this ended up being a non-issue.

We plugged them into the computer and immediately they lit up. I mean, there are lights on these things and when powered through the USB port they illuminate nicely. They look cool when they're lit and the lights are not super bright so this is not a bad thing.

The sound quality is very good. We decided to test them out with some music tracks that have a good range of sound and the headphones managed to give us good reproduction of sound without distortion and without overdriving the highs or lows. These are not quite audiophile quality but they are better than a lot of more expensive headphones I have used. The detail is there too so there should be no problem hearing more subtle sounds without cranking the volume too high.

The microphone itself is a little tricky to attach but if one pays attention when trying to attach it, it is not all that difficult. Once connected, it works very well and the noise-canceling aspect of the microphone itself helps to eliminate some of the background noise. The result is a fairly clear transmission of sound.

The cord has three plugs on it: one for the USB power, one for microphone in and one for headphone out. Its a nice, long cord too, so range of motion is not restrictive.

So far I cant find too much wrong with this headset. The sound quality is great, it seems to be well constructed and the price is not prohibitive. This is a solid offering the midrange of gaming headsets, and its definitely worth a look.",Excellent Midrange Gaming Headset,1385769600,3,,

I returned it and picked up the G602, the mouse I should have purchased in the first place. With 11 programmable buttons and various profiles, you can customize this mouse to nearly endless possibilities. It's ergonomics are great for me. The mouse sits well in my palm and doesn't leave me fatigued after hours of use. It has a tactile scroll wheel, which I really like compared to the free scroll option on the G700s. The wireless feature doesn't seem to detract from performance for my needs. I know this is marketed as a gaming mouse, but I am using it for photo and video editing. The programmable buttons come in handy when doing multiple tasks over and over. The batter life claims up to 250 hours on endurance mode. I have been running it on this mode since I got it and haven't noticed any downside to it. Two AA batteries will go a long way with this mouse!

I would highly recommend this mouse for those looking for a practical, usable, wireless mouse with programmable keys. This fits the bill!

5.0,False,"03 22, 2011",A3G6STJDOIMJPS,B0037UCT0O,Lea Goin,"LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars is a very strong entry into the world of LEGO based video games and mixes a bit of what is found in early titles along with some of the better gameplay enhancements made to the more recent titles.  It's got the tried and true Star Wars based action, humor, adventure, puzzles, and more found in the first game and they've really taken it to the next level with some of the new features.  The area that is essentially your ""hub"" area is a mix of the first Star Wars game with a central area, but you unlock new guys and other things by walking around the level and interacting with them ala the more recent LEGO titles.

Pros:
 - The new Jedi moves are a blast and the array of vehicles, monsters, turrets, and other things you can control this time around is fun.  They've taken what was fun about the first LEGO Star Wars series and built upon that and improved it.
 - We found the controls to be improved in areas, especially for the flying missions.  Otherwise, it's like hopping on a bike with this game, most of the controls are kept in-tact and are spot on.
 - The levels themselves seem to feature larger, more grand battles, more involving puzzles, and at times, you even find your characters in completely different areas. When playing co-op this means you'll sometimes find yourself working through puzzles and fighting baddies while your friend solves a puzzle or whatnot as you both achieve your individual goals.  This plays out very well in a split-screen manner.
 - Which brings us to the wonderful implementation of the split-screen cam as seen in more recent LEGO based games. The original Star Wars kept both characters on the same screen whereas TWC here splits the screen if you split up seamlessly.  (Say that three times quickly)  It's a cool effect that takes place if you or your coop friend take off by themselves, the screen splits smoothly with a rotating split so you can always seen which way you need to go to get back to your partner.  When you do get closer, the screens come back together and the split seam dissappears so you can both enjoy the wider view.  It's very nice being able to stick around collecting things or just exploring a bit while your friend is doing his thing also.
 - The graphics are great for the Wii although there is a bit of slowdown in the more open, large battles, but it's nothing that brings down the fun.  There is no question that he PS3 and 360 versions are going to look more impressive that the Wii version.  Overall though, the game is on par, if not better with some new effects over the original and that's satisfying.
 - Lots of interactivity.  There's a nice amount of stuff to fiddle with, build, force, hop on or in, and otherwise interact with.  The secrets are in, True Jedi is in, buying new characters, secrets, all of that is in.

Cons:
- No real cons although we have not tried much else than the SP Story mode so far.

At this point, we really enjoy the game and recommend it to anyone that enjoyed the first LEGO Star Wars game or anyone looking for a very fun coop romp through the land of Star Wars: The Clone Wars built in LEGOs.","If you've enjoyed the previous entries, you'll enjoy this title",1300752000,62,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii'},

Late in the game, though, the thugs suddenly start being able to block and dodge really well, which is annoying.

I'm talking about games like Halflife, No One Lives Forever, or Deus Ex that you don't want to end. I didn't want RTCW to end. The graphics are phenomenal- that is, the landscapes and charcter design are of the highest order. The Quake 3 engine that everyone is talking about is truly worthy of its acclaim. Everything has texture, the enemy AI is realistic, and the in-game dialogue is believable. However, the graphics and gameplay aren't what make this game truly amazing. The story is what RTCW will be forever remembered for. You get to fight Nazis,(always a plus in gaming), but also uncover the secrets of the Third Reich's Paranormal Division.

I suppose it all goes with the ""entitled"" generation, but I personally found lots to enjoy about this game.

First off, something that I'm sure has already been well documented, these graphics will really blow your mind. I have been gaming since the SNES days and this game has the best graphics I have ever seen on a console by far.

The aesthetics are all on point and I particularly love the whole Victorian era/Tesla-punk style that incorporated werewolves and vampires as well as other gothic lore such as the Order itself.

Now on to the criticisms. The first issue I had is a relatively small one and frankly just means that I liked the game so much I wanted more of it! People that complain about spending ""X"" amount of dollars on a video game to only get ""X"" amount of hours of gameplay are impatient and clueless. It's not about the amount of time you can play the game, it's about the quality of the experience. If someone gave you the game for free does your opinion change?

I didn't have a problem with the story but in a hopeful sequel I would like to delve more into the world and factions of The Order. I also think there needs to be more RPG elements to the game, most games these days either include RPG elements, open world elements or both, so to play a game without either seems a bit limited.

Finally the weapons. While the weapons were pretty sweet (especially the Tesla ones), there wasn't enough specialty weapons or items. Not being able to carry more than 1 rifle and 1 sidearm, while it seems realistic, did get frustrating at times.

I liked this game a lot and I know Ready At Dawn, who is still a young studio, will take fans opinions into consideration if and when they decide to go for a sequel.",Ready At Dawn Shows Extreme Promise 4.5*,1427673600,3,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}",

5.0,False,"04 30, 2012",A30EXX7DBQX1FB,B006ZPAYMI,Joseph,"My wife and I decided to purchase this game for our two sons (ages 5 and 4).  They absolutely love this game.  I highly recommend it.  There is enough variety in the game that it does not appear that they will tire of it any time soon.  Who am I kidding?  I love it, too.  That's right, I said it.  There is one mission in particular where my eldest son and I played co-op as rats from Ratatoulle (sp?) and we had to pick up and toss tomatos and oranges at the face of a chef.  It was hilarious.  But, there are so many other fun things to do in the game.

Playability/Mechanics:  The Kinect sensor is very responsive.  In addition to the traditional method of holding your ""hand"" over a button, they've included voice commands where you can just speak the button text to the Kinect and it launches the event without having to use the traditional method.  This is a great feature as my eldest can read the simple text so he chooses to shout the commands rather than ""pushing"" the buttons... my youngest is learning from his brother so he does the same thing.  There are several variations of play, but other than the driving ones (in the Cars themepark and scattered within the others), it mainly consists of running, jumping, picking up objects and throwing them, flying/gliding/sliding (holding your arms out to control direction or holding your arms up while you slid down a rope - even one-handedly), swinging, balancing, and climbing in several different settings.

Co-op:  It's brilliant.  Want to see the young ones finally work together to accomplish a goal?  What better way than in a video game.  When playing in co-op mode, there are many ""team"" objectives where one person has to do one thing and another has to do something else simultaneously in order to continue.  I was afraid that this would result in arguments between my two sons, but, on the contrary, they mastered the mechanics and actually do help each other out.

And, like I mentioned before, there are several themes.  When my sons tire of one theme, they exit and head to another.  It really is a perfect Kinect game for kids.","Very, very fun game",1335744000,14,,

The story could not possibly be better.  I get chills as I sit here thinking about how to describe it; it's that good.  The character development and interactions are some of the best I've ever seen in a game.  I found myself loving each and every one of the main characters, and the drama that goes on behind the scenes of the war is completely absorbing.

Graphically, it sublime.  Some of the best use of cel-shading in the business.  The overall tone and atmosphere are simply incredible.  No, it's not a gritty, realistic portrayal of war, but it's not meant to be.

And the gameplay -- dear god, the gameplay!  A totally fresh and innovative mix of tactical turn-based play with over-the-shoulder third-person action.  The class system is tight and engaging, and bringing the right mix of talent to each scenario is a great part of the game's challenge.

My fondest wish is that Sega will do a fantasy title along these same lines, something with a little melee and magic!  And while the tale told in Valkyria Chronicles is certainly epic, I could go for something even longer and more involved.  (There is downloadable content available, but I haven't had a chance to play it yet.)

Every time I play online, I pretty much play on a new map, how great is that? It's new and so I don't get tired of the game. This is because there is a map making mode that is a 100000x better than Halo's forge. There are maps that look like junk-yards, deserts, beaches, cities, jungles, and other stuff. People even make crazy interesting maps that change the game play like in one you're trapped in a building and you must snipe to fight. There are different game modes online as well. There is a turf war thing called uprising where winner controls 3 posts, there is a capture the flag mode, and of course there is a death-match and team death match mode. You can rate all the maps too so to fitter out the just ok ones. The bad thing is you can't really pick your character, but this isn't a big problem. You pick the weapon and a different guy will hold it, for example the basic sniper is always a dude with a cowboy hat (but at least 3 different guys wearing it). You can change weapons everything you die. You get new weapons when you buy them during the game. You can figure it out when you play, but the main thing is that you can progress your weapons while you the play the same match and map. So read other reviews for single player mode, but really you should buy this game just for the cool multi-player mode. Unlike Halo the maps have good places to snipe and hide, you can actually go inside buildings too. The graphics in this game are the best I've seen yet, but really video games need to catch up with movies. Like all games, the scenery is good, but unlike most games I've played the people in this game look more real, their skin looks rounded, smooth, and shinny, and the blood and fire look great as well.","Great game, one of my new favs, muti-player, xbox live",1281312000,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Wow, just wow. The whole game is HUGE. Took me over 75 hours just to play this one game. Was a little befuddled at the end since I felt like I did not get to choose my ending. I just walked forward and had the green ending, I did not know the other endings were to the left or right. Still, the ending was neat, very 'Asimov' like. I am going to replay the last bit again and choose the ending I wanted.

The whole game is just a masterpiece. There are so many different aspects of gaming. At its heart it was a shooter (I play Soldier  characters in ME). Then there is the open galaxy map and scanning planets all the while running from Reapers. And then there is a >bunch< of social stuff. Also, the Citadel, with the DLC, has a huge number of things to do. The Sim room was great!

Graphics and voice acting are top notch. I have always loved the ME soundtracks as well. Very cool music.

If there was one thing I'd like improvement on it would be more grenades. I'd love to use my grenades just a bit more, but refills are somewhat scarce so I would 'save' my grenades for touchy situations. ME3 also has the best skill system in the series.

At first I did not like the broken up health bar into smaller segments, but as I played it was pretty neat. I learned to use my shields far more then in ME1 or ME2.

The characters were awesome. With all of the DLC, every character that survived ME1 and ME2 made an appearance. Very cool.

The War Assets part was fun! With the DLC I had 8037 points. I don't multiplay, so at half galaxy readiness I had 4000+ war assets, definitely enough to get the best endings. (The Revised Ending DLC lowers the needed War Assets from 4000 to 3100 to get the best endings.)

I am wondering which ending will be chosen for the setting in the next Mass Effect game, which they are working on right now. We will probably see that game in 2016.

Oh, and the weapons and their modifications are awesome! Loved that part as well. The Collector's Edition guns were not bad either.

Also, the endings are just fine. Don't pay attention to the negative phoos. Just get the revised ending DLC and they are just fine.

Anyway, ME3 is easily my favorite game of all time. Loved it!",Mass Effect 3 Collector's Edition PS3,1406332800,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

This game is different from the previous Cake Mania games because it has 4 sections......Jill's bakery (obviously),  Risa's Flower Shop,  Jack's Burger Barn,  and Tiny's Sushi Bar.

Jill's Bakery....new look to the shop.  Larger buttons for the oven,  decorators, and frosters.  No side scrolling.

Jack's Burgers....similar to Burger Island (Making burgers and shakes, unlocking new recipes).

Risa's Flowers.....similar to original cake mania play except you are getting flowers,  wrapping them in various colors of paper, using different ribbons and decorations.

Tiny's Sushi....making sushi boxes (clicking on the different things you need as fast as you can....while earning chain bonuses),  unlocking new recipes.

In this game, Jill is trying to give Bakersfield (I think that the name of the town) a makeover.  You start out playing in her shop.  After completing a few levels,  Jack's Burger shack is unlocked.  After a few levels there,  then Risa's Flowers is unlocked....etc.  You don't have to FULLY complete any of these sections to move onto the next.  So it is possible to be playing all 4 levels at the same time.  You play for $ to upgrade the shops and also to pay for upgrades to the town.  There are some fun new characters, including a pirate, a gangster, and some interesting kids. (I am still trying to figure out what shows they all like to watch on TV to increase their patience.)

I also have the Logitech G11 gaming keyboard which I was using prior to this one. First of all, if you don't need a gaming keyboard, don't buy one. I noticed a few reviews that actually seemed to view this keyboard negatively for having lots of keys they won't use. Doesn't make sense, does it? If you are not a gamer or the idea of macro recording and extra keys doesn't entice you, this is a rather expensive keyboard. You would be much better off getting a wireless Logitech desktop for your non-gaming needs.

Now, if you ARE a gamer, welcome to heaven!! I absolutely love the softness of the keys on this keyboard. They are quiet and very responsive. The keys are silky smooth and it's just a joy to use. It has taken a bit to get used to the extra keys along the left side as they are so close to the rest of the keys and when not looking, it can be slightly annoying to find where you are on the keyboard. I'm sure this will disappear in a few more days of use though. All of the features on this keyboard are absolutely wonderful and I'm so glad they chose to go with the minimum features needed to enhance your game play and not clutter up the keyboard with a bunch of stuff you do not need.

The macro keys are awesome. Very easy to use and making new macros on the fly is quick and simple. The windows lock key is invaluable. Why has no one thought of this before?! I can't tell you how many times I've been in a heated PvP battle and accidentally hit my windows key. You know the rest. The headset and microphone mute buttons are also ingenious. Not everyone has a quality headset or microphone with a built in mute button, so this is priceless for those people and also more convenient for me to push one of these buttons rather than reach up to my head to mute the mic there. The back light turns on and off with a simple tap on the button. No need to open up a configuration program to turn it on and off. Nice. The back light is just the right intensity and the ability to change the colors (pink!) is very cool. The media player buttons are pretty standard on keyboards today, but I do love how they confined them to a small space on the right side of the keyboard so they aren't dominating my play area on the keyboard like others I have had. The volume wheel is also the best I have ever seen on a keyboard of any kind. I don't particularly like the volume dials that ""click"" with every movement because volume control can lack a lot of precision at times. One click can take you from too loud to so quiet you can barely hear it. This volume wheel is very smooth with no clicking and works like a dream. The mute button is also right beside it so you can quickly push it if you are like me and have to keep an ear out for a baby monitor in the evenings. Last but certainly not least, the USB 2.0 and headphone/microphone jacks are absolutely wonderful! I could never go back to a keyboard without at least one USB 2.0 port having so many gaming peripherals and electronic gadgets. My only gripe is that I wish they had kept the two USB 2.0 ports of the G11. All our headsets are USB anyway but we do have one headset that can be either.

I have to take the time to refute a few of the claims here on the other reviews as I don't believe this keyboard deserves the 3.5 stars it currently has here on Amazon. Some of the negative reviews are what made me skip over the G110 and try the G11 first. I honestly wish I had waited for this keyboard because it is superior in many ways. One reviewer states this keyboard feels cheap because it's lightweight. This keyboard absolutely does NOT feel cheap. Everything about it boasts quality. Just because it is lightweight does not mean it is garbage. I appreciate the fact that it's lightweight, as I'm sure many others do as well. It was also stated that this keyboard is unattractive. I can only assume this person was comparing photos and not actual products side by side because there is nothing unattractive about this keyboard, but it is a matter of opinion I suppose. Another reviewer compared it to the ""beautiful SideWinder X6"" which to me looks almost identical but with extra bulky buttons along the top side. And how much does it really matter when you don't usually look down at your hands while gaming, typing or anything else. I did at first think my G11 was more attractive than that G110 until I had them both in my lap. The layout of the G11 is meant to be pleasing to the eye with the mix of silver and black and the fancy handles?? on the top. But when you have them side by side and you see how enormous the G11 is beside this little beauty, it's easy to see why I favor the G110. The G11 has extra macro keys, true, but between the normal in game hot keys and my Razer Naga mouse with 12-key thumb pad, I don't need 54 potential macro keys. 36 suits me just fine.

It was also stated in a previous review that the back light is uneven or that you have to be looking straight down at the keyboard to even see it. This is just flat out untrue. Unless this person received a defective product, there is no way this is true. The lighting on my keyboard is just right. Bright enough to be clearly visible during daylight (which another reviewer stated was impossible) and dim enough that it isn't harsh on your eyes in the dark. The lighting is also perfectly even across all keys.

Another issue pointed out by other reviewers is the supposed lack of height from the feet on the back of the keyboard. The height on this keyboard is exactly the same as my other two Logitech keyboards. The perfect height for comfort and the removable wrist support is actually very functional on this keyboard. Normally I remove them because they are simply too low and do nothing to actually support my wrists. This keyboard sports the first wrist support that actually comes straight out from the keyboard and actually *gasp* supports my wrists. It's very comfortable and wonderful during long gaming sessions.

Overall, if you are looking for a quality gaming keyboard with lots of customizable keys and you aren't swayed by the largely unnecessary LCD screen of the G19 series, you really can't go wrong with the G110. Ignore the naysayers, you will absolutely love it. A great buy for the serious gamer who wants functionality and not flash.",Everything I have come to expect from Logitech,1261785600,257,,

5.0,False,"11 28, 2011",AYGZPH8RLIQYS,B005FEX576,Christopher,"I was cautious of Fishing Resort, when a game is a new release and has a discounted price that is usually a red flag. But I ignored my ""spidey-sense"" and bought it (had to buy it with the rod, only one store in town had it and they only had one). I quickly discovered that I was wrong, Fishing Resort is a great game.

The beauty is in the simplicity: You're on vacation to Panagkapan Island (a tropical location that oddly has areas each with their own drastically different climate) and you're there to fish. The fish you catch earn you points (the currency on the island) and you use the points to buy new tackle and gear, as well as cloths for the character you create (you can't use you Mii, unfortunately). For those who want more substance, there are missions given by the other island-goers, daily activities to participate in (going trolling out in the ocean, catching specific fish for people, and competitions), as well as online leaderboards and new fish that are added via wi-fi (essentially, free dlc).

What I really enjoy is the cohesiveness: you wake up in your hotel room and make your way out to the beach. Don't want to walk? Purchase a bike for the day and go cycling. You never are required to accept missions or participate in extra activities (although it'll earn you more money), you can simply fish and enjoy the ambience. Too many fishing games I've tried are arcadey and break the immersion. This game embraces the quiet serenity of fishing.

As far as negatives go, the day night cycle is great but you're forced to go back to your hotel room when it gets too late (although eventually there is a way to stay out very late). The multiplayer is odd - when you're fishing you can add wii remotes and there will be another person fishing alongside you, whoever hooks first the camera zooms in on them as they reel in the fish. The fishing rod accessory works well...but I prefer playing without it. The motion controls really do work well (this game is actually motion-plus compatible, something not marked on the box) but casting my line doesn't always read.

It really is a fantastic game, and I know it will be overlooked. Obviously the publishers fealt the same way because the $20-$30 price is clearly not because of a lack of quality on the developers part.

It's a spin off and also the end of the Tokyo location and game engine..Hence the title ""of the end"". Part 5 is being developed as we speak with tons of work to be done considering they are making a whole new engine. Now I won't go into heavy detail as I did with my Yakuza 4 review, but give my pros and cons.

Pros:

Storyline- Can never say more than enough for a STELLAR storyline.. you will not find better from any series including cutscenes.
Characters- The loan Shark,Dragon of Kansai and Majima join Kazuma into gunning hordes of zombies popping heads like it's going out of style. Can't ask for a better team.
Graphics- Same as 4,same engine..Love it or hate it, it works.
Mini games- Are all here..Whether you like to bowl, play slots,arcades,cards,mahjong,hostess bars,batting cages,karaoke,massage parlors tell me when to stop..And many many side missions for each character(One example is saving store fronts and reopening businesses).
When complete you can have the option to travel around a normal town or apocalyptic town with zombies.

Cons:

Sadly the controls are a little problematic at first,but as you play you will be popping heads with a hostess in no time.
Some Framerate issues at times.

Overall it's a great end to this engine and the Tokyo location. I hope when 5 is complete they bring it to the West. Sadly other reviewers will sway hordes of people from even touching the series. Thank you Sega for supporting your fans.",Pop Heads with a Hostess?,1331510400,5,,

5.0,False,"07 27, 2014",A2582KMXLK2P06,B00004SVNL,Bryan,"Here's a quick story.  It's rather sad I'm afraid.  Not sad as in tearful necessarily, but in a life-changing and tragic kind of way.  When I was a kid in the late 80's my mom took me to either Sears or Woolworth in Delaware so we could purchase a video game.  At the time I thought Bionic Commando looked kind of cool from the little bit of information I knew about it based on gaming magazines and perhaps even word of mouth.  To my surprise the game was actually available so we purchased it, bring it home, I pop it into the NES... and it doesn't work.  All that appears is a black screen.  I had this same issue with another game at a yard sale called Marble Madness and when I took it back they allowed me to trade it for Robocop.  Good trade there, however...

Despite doing everything in my power to get Bionic Commando to work that one summer afternoon, it does not.  A brand new game popped in the NES but the black screen wouldn't go away no matter how hard I try.  When I take it back... I decide to get another game... and the game I get is Yoshi (a puzzle game).  No, not Yoshi's Cookie- just Yoshi.  A Tetris-like puzzle game.  I think this deserves a big ""AHHH WHAT WAS I THINKING?!?!"" moment!  Seriously, Yoshi instead of Bionic Commando?  *smacks self really hard*

Anyway, it's now a quarter of a century later and I'm getting to know Bionic Commando for real this time.  I'm actually rather surprised at a couple things.  First I thought the game was more open world than it really is.  The areas look much smaller now compared to 25 years ago obviously, but I really thought the levels were huge even back in the day.  The game doesn't really deliver much concerning a feeling of exploration, but what it DOES do exceptionally well is provide a slice of shooting, bionic arm swinging entertainment that made me realize why I wanted this game so much back in the day- it's unique.  Swinging from platform to platform instead of jumping on them like in every other game was an original idea that undoubtedly influenced Nintendo to create the same concept with the grapple hook in Super Metroid a few years later.

Simply put, swinging from your bionic arm all over the place (at fairly good speed too, which is another surprise) and shooting the bad guys is absolutely fun.  There's a LOT of strategy involved in finding the right ways to swing your bionic arm.  Sometimes the path isn't always clear whether it be up, down left or right which requires the player to give the game a strategic approach in order to succeed.  You have to look thoroughly at your surroundings sometimes and be a little creative in order to get around.  This isn't always easy however, since even when you do eventually find the right way to travel there's a severe threat of danger around many corners (usually gunfire).  Be alert when you play this game.

At least you're given up to 6 hits (the green bars you see in the top left corner) before you lose a life.  Each hit takes away one bar. Your life bar builds slowly throughout the game.  Also ALWAYS collect the 1-ups for goodness sake!  They help a lot.  Also notable is that there's other games such as a top/down view involving your character moving upwards towards the destination shooting everyone in sight (this one's fun but somewhat repetitive since it's frequent and doesn't offer much in the way of variety), the ability to choose where you want to go on the map screen, and the many battles with the superweapon which is basically the games occasional boss fight.  The battle is always the same however the danger surrounding it increases and changes as you progress, as does the challenge level, so these fights don't feel repetitive at all.

And I absolutely LOVE the melodic heroic music that makes up many of the theme songs.  Okay so the bionic arm swinging concept wasn't fully utilized or maybe it was and the limited space of the NES cartridge assured the game had to be short, but who cares seriously.  This game's awesome and just downright fun to play.  The storyline that involves saving a commando is memorable since the characters in this game are actually full of personality which isn't something I can say about most NES games.  The text is readable and memorable too.  I highly recommend picking this game up.  It's better than Yoshi, haha!

Oh and before I forget to mention it- if you like this game, I seriously recommend another NES title called P.O.W. (Prisoners of War).  While that game is significantly easier than Bionic Commando and doesn't contain as much exploration (or the bionic arm) it's equally fun and satisfies your desire for gun shooting action and adventure in the same way as Bionic Commando.",commanding excellence,1406419200,,,

Fletcher,"As this is my second Logitech G700 Wireless Laser Gaming Mouse (I bought the original non-""s"" model on release), so you can tell how much I like them.  As a ""claw"" style mouse user I found the shape and size just right for long gaming and web browsing sessions.  I have used this mouse with most of the bigger games out right now- Mass Effect 3, Civilization 5, Team Fortress 2 in extended use and have had no issues.  The wireless charge lasts longer that you will want to play, and the ergonomic shape helps me avoid wrist issues. The ""s"" model has some nice new surface treatments which help grip as well- I found those to be nice touches.

Packaging: somewhat Apple-like in that someone clearly spent some time and care putting a nice presentation together.  Everything looks nice, and is easy to get at everything.  No knives, scissors or battle axes needed for once- so kudos to Logitech.

Installation:  You will need two free USB ports, with one preferably on the front (or near the front) of the machine.  If you don't have one near the front, Logitech is smart enough to have provided a USB extender cable for the wireless dongle.  The other USB port is for the charging cable (which allows for wired use as well- you can charge and use it at the same time if needed).  I used an out of the way USB port in an external USB hub without issue for this.  While the mouse and dongle are plug and play in Windows 7, I would strongly recommend downloading the Logitech Gaming Software.  This is the best way to use all the amazing options this mouse has.  I have used both the 32bit (at work) and the 64bit (my gaming machine) versions.  From the software you can easily adjust the DPI Sensitivity levels, the polling rate of the mouse, add, remove or adjust individual game profiles (important for RTS and MMO players) and even adjust the power settings for power saving or max gaming. So not only did it have all the features I wanted, it had a few I never even considered.

Use: My original G700 has seen extremely heavy use since I got it with zero issues.  Despite daily use, the battery still charges up nicely.  I have never had any driver crashes or issues, and Logitech does a nice job of updating the Gaming Software over time.  The new ""s"" version has 10 hours of gaming on it already (it came with a decent charge fortunately) and I like the updates they did on it.  My old G700 is now on my work machine, where it is a massive improvement over the crap Dell mouse that came with that system. The G700 just works right.  Day after day, game after game.

Final thoughts:  if you are a claw style user and are looking for the best value and capabilities in a Wireless Laser gaming mouse, it is very hard to beat the G700s mouse in conjunction with the Logitech Gaming Software.  Highly recommended.",My favorite wireless mouse for both gaming and office use,1366588800,5,,

Well,  when reading all the previous reviews for this game title, I too felt uneasy to buy it for my PC, but I bought it anyway to see for myself. There is also a parental guide that is mentioned at the bottom of this review.

What are the minimum system requirements for this game?

Operating  System: Windows XP/Windows Vista (I use Win7 and it works just fine) - Memory:  1GB RAM - 4.7 GB of hard drive disc space.
Processor: Intel Pentium 4 (3+ GHZ) - AMD Athlon 3000+
Video Card: DirectX 9.0c Shader 3.0 supported Nvidia 6800 or 7300 or better - ATI Radeon X1300 or better.
Sound Card: DX9-compatible.
Xbox 360 controller compatible. (Optional)

Will this game work on PC?

Yes. This game works near perfect after downloading the latest patch online, which only takes a couple minutes. There are no major glitches that will make it un-playable. All glitches are minor.

What are the glitches in this game?

Before I mention the glitches, I should mention first that the PC I run this game on is equipped with way more than the requirements for this game. So be sure you reach the standards of this game.
As for glitches... There are only a few I found so far and that is:  1. NPCs rarely get stuck while trying to move or interact with other NPCs. ( Note: this will not mess up your progress in the game. It is very minor.)  2. This might just be my graphics settings and/or card, but once in a great while some graphics on the map do minor flickering but disappear in seconds.  3. Rare loading lag when riding around the map. But to me that is normal for most games.
That's about it.

How does it compare to Xbox 360?

In my opinion, the PC version is much better than the Xbox 360 version. Why? With your graphics and resolution set to high, the PC version looks MUCH better than the Xbox 360 version. Plus the loading time on PC is faster. (Depending on your PC specs.)

But with Xbox 360 you do get Achievements for your Xbox account and that is always a plus because it's fun to have an extra challenge.

Is the PC version of Bully hard to control?

To be honest, I never played it on a keyboard and I cannot imagine how I could play it on keyboard. I'm not that skilled. BUT there is a solution for those who do not want to play it with the keyboard. Use an Xbox 360 controller. It's very simple. All you do is plug the controller into your PC, then download the drivers from Microsoft and install. You probably do not need to go to the website though, because mine installed automatically after plugging it in. There is no configurations you need to do to the controller. The buttons are pre-set and ready to play. You do not even need an Xbox 360 to do this either. As for me, I bought the controller and Bully together from Amazon and when it arrived at my house it worked exactly like it would work for the Xbox 360. I used to own an Xbox 360 a long time ago so I understand how it works on Bully.

How graphic and violent is Bully?

I put this question and answer here for parental reasons. Being a parent myself, I understand the thought of what your kids and teens play. So if you're not a parent or you do not care what your kid plays and sees, then there is no need for you to read this.
What I know about Bully's graphic and violent behaviour is this... It is definitely a BAD influence for both kids and teens. Especially for the kids and teens who are easily influenced.  Aside from the near constant beating and threating of people on the game, there is also cussing, teasing, sexual harassment, gang violence, alcohol usage, drug usage, crude and rude humour and cruelty to animals. Along with hurting people, this game allows you to hurt dogs. You are also allowed to kill rats and throw the bodies at other people and/or animals. That's not all. You are also allowed to blow up any toilet in a school with a firework, throw fireworks at people which explodes at their body and face, throw stink bombs at people, shoot people with a sling shot, grab other girls and minor girls' butts and more. The ratings are not what they used to be so beware of rated T. In my opinion, this game should be M. I believe it is only T because there is no blood.

The Ps3 version of this collection sucks. Mostly all games for the ps3 suck (I'm not a fanboy of Xbox 360) Games like Fallout 3, Oblivion, Fallout New Vegas,Skyrim, and now the Silent hill collection will not run as good or even close to their counterpart on the Xbox 360. I REALLY wanted this game for my Ps3 and probably will buy it again for it, but I'm holding out until they fix it in some way. The problem between the two is that the Ps3 frame rate stutters horribly, you start running and you will slow down drastically as well as the enemies, and mostly the game frizzes. Checkout you tube to see the mess in action. On the Xbox 360 version you will get everything smoothly. The game might stutter once or twice during cut scenes but that's nothing.
 The game itself is straight to the point, you get Silent Hill 2 Restless Dreams and Silent Hill 3. Silent hill 2 gives you the option for new voice acting or the original voice acting, while Silent hill 3 only has the new voices only. The games to me look great in hd, yes some fog effects are gone and the streets are brand new, as well as the music in Silent Hill 3 is somewhat different, but that comes with a hd remake You also get 50 Achievements 25 for each game. If you did brought this remake and are experiencing problems then just return it and get the Xbox 360 version if you do not own an Xbox don't worry cuz konami is going to release them individually on psn network maybe those will have it run smoothly.

Each grip has a textured rubber face so it's comfortable to handle and doesn't slip. It is essentially a Playstation layout, and close enough to the Xbox controller to make Xbox fans comfortable.

Like with most products, I recommend visiting the company's website to ensure you install the latest version of software.  You can certainly install the software from the included CD, but it is best to use the latest revision from the website.

I think the key selling point of this product is flexibility: it can be switched from DirectInput mode (older games)to XInput mode (newer games) and back again.  Plus it includes the Profiler software.  This Windows software lets you customize the controls for use with games that do not have native gamepad support.  Basically, you can program the 510 to emulate keyboard and mouse tasks.

I cannot think of a single downside to this controller.  It is simple to connect, comfortable, easy to use, and its programmable, if you simply have to have this or that key set up some particular way you like.
The vibrations produced by the controller are typical of a ""rumble pad"".  They work fine and they aren't weak.

Price-wise, you can find less expensive product, but as the saying goes, you get what you pay for.
By the way, Logitech warranties the 510 for 2 years.  Although gaming controllers tend to hold up, it's still nice to have a company that gives you more than 90 days.

He was responsible for the murder of millions and it is possible that by killing him before he could reach adulthood, the world would not have gone down a certain path and millions of people would have been saved. But to save them, you would also have the physical act of killing a small child on your conscience. And without Hitler, someone else would have risen up, maybe not as bad, maybe somehow worse, but there's no real guarantee.

It shouldn't really be a tough question to answer. One life vs tens of millions. At that ratio, I'd wager that Hitler himself would think it was a worthy tradeoff.

So Bioshock is back in the year 2013. The first game was pretty groundbreaking for its combination of state of the art graphics and a strong narrative with high-minded concepts backing it up. Bioshock Infinity continues that, although for the time I don't find the graphics as impressive as the original Bioshock. The graphics are improved, but not five-years improved, and several of the faces are actually pretty lackluster compared to even older games like Half Life 2.

It does feel better thought-out though. The story is unfolded in a superior manner, map layouts are better, gameplay is more fun. The guns have a louder bang to them than most any game out there, feeling like wild gun-powder based weapons and not squirt guns like many games. You can also shoot ""magic"" at any time. Some of the abilities are akin to a grenade throw. Others clearly show the influence of Mass Effect, especially Bioshock's version of the biotic charge. Me being a fan of the Vanguard class, this is a big plus.

New is the addition of a speed rail system that you can slide on while in combat, moving you quickly around the map. You can also summon more powerful objects, like combat robots, turrets, and health. however, only two can be active at a time, and you have to focus for a few seconds in summoning them.

The new additions make for very fast-paced combat, with lots of movement, lots of strategic decisions. It is the best FPS combat system I've ever played.

The maps, however, seem a little cramped. I blame this on the aging memory limitations of the PS3 and Xbox 360. Thus, the backdrops are simple...background, and they aren't something you can really reach. in contrast, a game like World of Warcraft, one of the wonders is that if you see something in the horizon, you can probably reach and touch it.

The story I found to be engaging, though at first it is pretty ham-fisted. the great sin of America is slavery, and yet why is it perpetuated in a city in the sky filled with marvelous technology? Younger players might find it a lot more mind-blowing than I.

So yeah, it's a good game worth playing. The only wish I really have is that they had developed for the next gen PS4 platform, which could do a city in the sky better justice.

5.0,False,"04 5, 2007",A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000LY4IDK,Cloud,"My cousin was a massive RPG fan in the day, playing everything from Secret of Mana to Link to the Past to Chrono Trigger. The other one that he played heavily was Final Fantasy III. It's common knowledge by now that III was the third game released in America even though Japan had released six, hence America numbering it 3. Despite the fact the game's been out for years and I even own the Anthology release, I decided to properly play the game since I never beat it before and it's still a great story, memorable characters and scenes while having solid gameplay. It bugs me that there has been multiple releases of the same game but when it's as good as Final Fantasy VI, it's forgivable.

Story: Previous installments took place in a more fantasy Medieval Ages-type setting. VI shows more of an Industrial Era world with the ancient magic disappearing and technology starting its takeover. The Gestahlian Empire has been making problems for the people with resistance from a small group called the Returners. One day, an Empirical soldier named Terra is found with amnesia and they decide to take her in and figure out how to take down the Empire and restore the world to normal.

Graphics: Strangely enough the graphics almost seem...sharper here. But it's basically the same thing that was on SNES and the PSX release but more cleaner. It of course looks outdated, especially when it employs the Mode-6 system and we get the 3D-esque stuff. But it's got enough of a look to keep you interested as well as some humorous moments when characters do an exaggerated shocked reaction.

Sound/Music: The effects are pretty minimal but where the game shines naturally is in the music. Before composer Nobuo Uematsu started to do the whole rock orchestra stuff, he did some of the most catchiest and heartfelt pieces of music around. From the ethereal Terra's Theme (made even better on a separate piano release) to the eerie Phantom Forest to the opera favorite Aria de Mezzo Caraterre to the psycho-ish Dancing Mad, nearly every track is a keeper. But you'll notice some of it just...sounds different. It's best that you buy the soundtrack since not only does it sound better but it's just good support.

Gameplay: Final Fantasy tends to be separated into 2 categories: job systems and assigned classes. Either you can manipulate what your characters can become (Materia System, Job System) or each character has a specific style of fighting (Final Fantasy IX and IV). VI has kind of a mix where each character has a specific class such as a thief, a ninja, an artist that can control the enemies and many more. However, there's a system called the Esper system where the summons (""Espers"" in the game) can be attached to a character one at a time and you can learn the spells that comes with each one and have little bonuses.

The game isn't really that difficult but it's best to level up at periodic times rather than going into grinding mode and levelling up like crazy. Some enemies are pretty easy but other times you'll find it gets tense and you'll feel relief when you win. If there is any flaw at all with the game, it's that there's tons of characters. Some of them get backstories to uncover, while others just feel thrown in there. It allows a bigger range of characters to choose from but the party just seems too stacked and full.

When it comes down to Final Fantasy games and which one's the best, the general consensus is that it's either the ever-popular VII or this one.

An entire game focused on Captain Toad? Why not! But to me, the most unusual announcement recently was ""Hyrule Warriors,"" which is exactly what it sounds like. That is to say, a ""Zelda"" game that plays exactly like a ""Warriors"" title, albeit with a few tweaks. Would this be a simple reskin, a la the ""Dynasty Warriors Gundam"" titles, or would it bring the best of both series together in a deliciously orgasmic package? The series have very little in common, and putting them into one game sounded like the most incongruous mixture possible.

Pleasingly, ""Hyrule Warriors"" represents the very best of franchises in varying capacities. Koei-Tecmo brings its satisfying core formula of ""press one or two buttons to kill hundreds of enemies in minutes,"" Team Ninja spices said formula up with gameplay mechanics that lend a distinct variety and weight to each attack, and Nintendo brings its established lore and does some really funky stuff with it, in the best way possible. These three forces collude to produce a game that is rich in content and heavy in fun, not to mention some of the most fun I've had with a co-op game in a long time.

From a narrative stand-point, this is one of the more interesting ""Zelda"" titles out there. A new villain, the unrealistically proportioned sorceress Cia, tears rifts between different points in Hyrulian history in an attempt to cause disorder and steal Link's soul. This is a sinister and evil plot, yes, but it's also an advantageous one for longtime fans of the franchise. The reason? It's the perfect excuse for fan-favorite characters from different games to team up and knock down evil forces side-by-side. So, aside from a patently annoying original character (Lana, a walking anime stereotype,) players will be able to get their hands on Midna, Ruto, Darunia, and many others, anachronistically teaming up to dispatch foes both fresh and familiar.

There's obviously a lot more going on in the plot, but to spoil it would be a crime. While it would be silly to say that this is one of the absolute best ""Zelda"" storylines, it's certainly one of the more interesting ones. It constantly undermines your expectations, despite some jaw-droppingly predictable ""twists,"" and does away with the traditional ""one villain"" storyline that's made of the more recent entries a bit stale. It's also a novel concept to have three different periods in history appearing at the same time and interacting with each other, something that I've always longed to see happen. While there are no real moments of emotional resonance or significant character development going on here, there's a sense of chaotic whimsy that feels really fresh and interesting. Most importantly, it avoid the pitfalls of many crossover titles, and for that, it deserves some praise.

That sentiment can be echoed for the gameplay as well. Many crossover titles lose something in translation, favoring one franchise too much and the other too little, or doing something entirely unwelcome and feeling nothing like either franchise. But here, it truly feels like a wonderful mash-up between both franchises, much like this year's earlier ""Professor Layton VS Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney."" Players will hack through thousands of enemies in a fast, frantic fashion, and unleash ridiculous special moves that devastate the opposition. They'll capture bases, take on special enemies, and upgrade their gear. But on that same token, maps are sprawling and varied, peppered with hidden collectibles and chests, and many possessing a signature boss fight that can only be effectively fought with a certain item. Koei-Tecmo and Team Ninja have both brought their own things to the table, but without losing the fantastical atmosphere and sense of exploration that comes with Nintendo's flagship.

There's no hurting for both variety and depth of content here, either. On top of Legend mode, which is where the narrative unfolds, there's Free Mode (a hallmark of the Warriors series) in which players can play through any story level with any character they've unlocked thus far. There's also Adventure mode, where players progress on a charming 8-Bit recreation of the 1987 ""The Legend of Zelda"" map, taking on special challenges along the way. Each mode interacts with the others, too, meaning that materials collected, characters unlocked, and levels gained in one mode count towards the other two. As if this, along with the numerous collectible trinkets and healthy catalog of unlockable music, wasn't enough, everything in ""Hyrule Warriors"" can be tackled with two players locally (one on the TV, one on the WiiU GamePad.) Playing this with a friend or significant other comes highly recommended, as it makes tackling tasks easier by leaps and bounds. One player can conquer a base while the other hunts for a Golden Skultula, for example, and both can then come together to tackle a boss. This is one of the finer examples of local co-op I've seen in recent years, and with minimal slowdown, there's no reason not to play this with another person if you can.

There have been some reviews disparaging the visual quality of ""Hyrule Warriors,"" and to be blunt, they can sod off. It might not have the resolution and parity of, say, a AAA title on the PS4 or One, but for what it's trying to do, it more or less hits the mark. The maps are carefully crafted and beautifully designed, taking players from a tree-top village to the depths of ""Ocarina of Time""'s infamous Water Temple, among many other locales, some new, some fresh takes on old classics. Despite some occasional texturing issues, each map does a good job of pulling one in, especially with the usage of varied, vibrant colors. The real showstopper here, though, are the characters. Everybody on display looks absolutely magnificent, rendered with the utmost attention to detail and fluidly animated. While Cia's design reminds me of what a horny middle-school boy would create on DeviantArt, everyone else looks great. Again, this might not win any awards for sheer horsepower, and the camera could use a little work (it has the tendency to grow unfocused from time to time,) it makes up for it with style and variety.

""Hyrule Warriors"" is a lovely bit of fan service to longtime fans of the ""Zelda"" franchise, packed to the brim with content (with more on the way for some time to come,) fun to play, look at, and listen to. It avoids some of the monotonous repetition that comes with certain ""Warriors"" games, and the plodding pace that comes with some ""Zelda"" titles. Without strictly being one game or the other, it somehow represents both titles at their very best, and it's quite obvious that a massive amount of effort went into making this game just right.

If you have a WiiU, love ""Zelda,"" and like killing lots of things at once with friends, it doesn't get much better than ""Hyrule Warriors."" Also, you can bring down the moon from ""Majora's Mask"" and crash it into a dragon using hookshots that spring forth out of a magical abyss.

I rest my case.

Pros:
- Polished gameplay, tons of content
- A great balance of both franchises
- Excellent co-op
- Looks and sounds great

Cons:
- Camera can be wonky at times
- Only three or four Zelda games are pulled from
- Main campaign is a bit short

5.0,False,"05 12, 2003",A20TY43A5VXOZW,B00004SVSS,Ed Oscuro,"Now with the understatement of the decade, let's look at this title in more depth. The original Ninja Gaiden is still one of the best titles available on the NES. Games of this era were generally quite hard, since sheer difficulty was generally the main way a developer created replay value. That said, this game is as hard--perhaps harder at times--as Ghosts n' Goblins, making it arguably one of the toughest games out there. Unlike Gn'G, though, this difficulty is due to the tightly patterned design of the levels and enemy attacks that must be faced rather than randomness or poor programming.
For such a small program (256K,) this title does a highly recommendable job with the graphics. Stylish, very well orchestrated and designed cutscenes make the most of tight restrictions; the title screen is quite impressive for the NES as it leads right into the cutscene as a good movie might. Most levels are packed with layered scrolling backgrounds giving a great sense of depth, though this isn't evident from playing the first level (a rather odd version of late 1980s America, complete with biker guys wielding clubs and gun-toting punk rockers). It is easy to see how some might consider this a Castlevania ripoff--coming slightly more than two years after the original 1986 Famicom Disk System version of that game, this one has a sidescrolling perspective, special weapons work in a similar way and, most importantly, are often found inside lanterns! It is a very shallow comparison, however. Ninja Gaiden has you leaping all about the place with stunning speed--you grasp walls and bounce off street signs to get to high places, and the general emphasis is on getting There, wherever that might be, instead of beating whatever is in your way to bits.
Sound is actually quite good. Across the board there are a couple outstanding tunes, and you won't be getting any headaches soon from this game's music.
This game (even more than most 16 bit titles) has a sense of scale and depth that few others even begin to compete with. Ninja Gaiden moves you across the world on a quest of such scale that it's hard to put a finger on it--demons, the CIA, and traditional Japanese virtue all have their place here.",Cinematics on your NES!

5.0,False,"02 22, 2010",A1MRPX3RM48T2I,B000F5IH2I,Trenton Bennett,"There are some games that have trouble moving forward over the years:  either the type of game falls out of favor (like Adventure games did for a while) or the technology flies forward with no real way to adapt the old to the new.  Worst of all, being a sequel that comes from a long line of sequels can bring massive amounts of excess baggage from the game's predecessors that can't (or won't) be jettisoned.

Having played many an RPG, I'm very pleased to say that Final Fantasy XII navigates smoothly around all these troubles. It does an excellent job of focusing on what matters most:  a rich Role-Playing Game experience that is also rather easy to use.  Having tried their hand at just about every variation of the genre, Square Enix gives us this culmination of lessons learned, and the end product is immersive, beautiful, and fun.

Players used to the Final Fantasy series are also accustomed to having unique and complex capabilities as far as HOW they play.  If I were to start telling you about FFXII's Licenses, Gambits, Mists, and ESPers, chances are your head would spin--it's deep stuff.  In earlier titles like Final Fantasy VIII this was problematic:  the way you handled abilities and magical creatures who help you and special boosts to your weapons and stats was complicated and hard to keep track of.  Here however we have a smooth flow that slowly introduces you to the concepts and gives you a chance to try each one as you progress in the game.  Gameplay elements are better organized and not as dependent on each other.

Perhaps one of the best features in the game is ""Gambits"":  instead of manually managing every character's every action in every turn, you can apply a certain amount of intelligence to your characters using multiple rules that you create.  This can easily be done.  For example, you can have your healer heal anyone when their health falls below 40%.  You can have a party member choose to attack the nearest enemies, or to focus on whichever enemy the leader is attacking.  You can tell a magic using character to throw certain spells based on certain events.  You can organize the Gambits to better automate actions: ""attack whatever the party leader is attacking.  Failing that, just attack the nearest enemy.""  And with one tap of a button, you can override these behaviors at any time.

Another excellent feature is Licenses.  They represent a grid of all the possible skills a character can have, and they give you a seemingly infinite depth of choices for each player:  no longer do you have to choose narrow character types, like ""Mage"", ""Fighter"", ""Healer"".  Instead you simply choose how to spend points you accumulate to pick skills, spells, and equipment for each.  Naturally, this makes character mistakes easy to remedy, and it also means replaying the game can be a very different experience every time.

There are other exciting features to the gameplay that would easily double the size of this review...so let's move on to the game elements themselves.  Probably the only real limitation to this game is that it was crafted for the PlayStation 2.  Cutscenes are stunningly gorgeous, but while the in-game graphics are among the best the PS2 had to offer, this still means things look a bit blocky, edges jagged and detail a bit muddied.  When you play, you will face loading screens that transition you from one area to another, but thankfully Square occasionally fills the gaps a bit with cinematic-style transition scenes.  Moving through the story brings characters who come and go:  some are guests you have no control over.  Others join with you and become playable characters you can control.  You even have allies who may change sides, and the next thing you know you're battling your own comerades in the fight to save the world.  My only complaint in this area is that you are only allowed to take 3 of your characters ""out of the box"" at a time.  You can change back and forth any time you like, even swapping out KO'd characters for live ones, but it would be a bit more fun for me if I could have 4 characters under my control instead of 3.

Things don't stop there:  while we have gorgeous artwork, a beautifully orchestrated score, rich gameplay, and a complex system with an easy learning curve, we get the rest of the package, too:  great writing.  Interesting characters with diverse backgrounds, storylines that peg the dramatic moments and bring you along on the highs and lows of the story, drawing you in to a deep and at times very complicated plot.  There are political alliances and shadow arrangments, with people shifting sides as the story goes along.

If you're interested in the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy XII is about as good as the later titles get.  If you're already familiar with the series from earlier titles, you might be pleasantly surprised at the amount of polish that has been put on this title.  If you're completely new to the RPG genre, expect this to be fairly complicated:  read the manual closely, pay attention to tutorials, and do a little reading online to immerse yourself.

-music- i'm a stickler for the audio department, but
capcom seldom lets me down. resident evil-esque music
haunts you, until enemies pop up. the music gets
intense and sets the mood perfectly. the sound effects
and general ambience are outstanding as well. the
atmosphere permeates from this one as grass ruffles and
guns scream out their blasts. superb!
-gameplay- ""okay, so it looks and sounds great...so do
so many flops now-a-days."" true, so what's to get
all excited about? what makes it unique and stand out?
the gameplay! one of the first combo's you'll be
bustin' out has you using a sword and twin pistols
together. something i haven't read about yet(because not
many have played the full version, yet) is how many
""toys"" you can use.  believe me, the sword and twin
pistols are the bottom of the barrel...and guns come
with unlimited ammo. think onimusha, another capcom
great, for some of the feel of the combat system. also,
collecting orbs from your defeated foes to ""level up""
of sorts, and learn new techniques comes intact. plus,
the silky smooth controls truly consider what gamers
have been complaining about since the time when the term
""3-D"" actually impressed. the gameplay makes this game
fun, and that's what playing a game is about, right?
right!
okay, so what could be bad?
well...not much. nothing, really. here are some
nitpicks!
CONS(nitpicking)
-jumping-my nitpick with this is that it's realistic.
crazy, huh? it uses the system from the first
castlevania where you can't change directions in mid-
air. there is nothing wrong with this until you include
platform jumping in your exercise routine. in defense,
the game does help you along in the few platform jumping
moments...
-respect the glass- how many of you gamers
have wasted a bullet or two just to see if the mirror
or glass would break in resident evil, dino crisis,
onimusha, etc.? it didn't work, did it? not here,
either! i can take down the mightiest spider, fend
off the most hideous minion of evil, heck...even give
a t-rex a run for his money, but break glass? huh-uh!
no way! if capcom keeps this up, it could just be
as tradition as a dove in a john woo film!
oh, well. i can't nitpick anymore. this game is a
masterpiece! wait 'til you fight the bosses! face
legions of enemies that fill rooms gauntlet style!
clear your first room of baddies and think you must
be a god! all the detail, all the atmosphere, all
the items, enemies, weapons, secret missions and
attitude! all the time i could have been playing
while typing this! it's violent, so if you're a
concerned parent, keep this in mind, but if you've
played capcom's latest games then you know what to
expect in this department. trust me, get this game...
it's that good!

5.0,False,"08 9, 2005",A3REUILBAGPS06,B000692N0K,Freth,"Remember how the previous versions of Settlers had a big focus on resource gathering and expansion to the point of micro-management and by the time you reached the point where you had enough resources to amass an army it seemed like a moot point?  I've played the original Settlers series for years and during long hours at LAN parties the game would end up crashing before we were able to have any meaningful battles.  The Settlers series of 4 and prior was all about building yourself up and fighting seemed like an afterthought.

Enter Heritage of Kings: The Settlers.  The resource gathering is still a primary focus, but it has been dumbed down just enough so that you can focus on what the purpose of the game is, to conquer.  Where before you never got to that point in Settlers 1 thru 4, now you actually do experience battle and the game is more evenly paced.

I'll give you a perfect example:  I haven't purchased the game yet.  Why?  Because I decided to download the demo and try it first.  What ended up happening is I spent about 4 hours building my kingdom and amassing troops to conquer neighboring kingdoms.  I went almost all the way through the technology tree as it is allowed in the demo (which is a step or two from the top) and I thoroughly enjoyed the game.  My point is it's as captivating as Settlers 1 thru 4 was, but in a more balanced way.  There's still fun to be had by playing the previous games, which is why you should own a copy of Settlers 4 and Heritage of Kings: The Settlers, so you can have the best of both worlds.

And no, I don't consider this game a sell-out.  I consider it a welcome change.  They focused on what needed to be fixed in order to give combat a chance in the game.  Also, the kingdom you build is much more fleshed out and believable.  I say why complain when Settlers 4 is about as good as you're going to get with the prior version.  I think if they had released another game that played the same people would be even more upset.  After all Settlers 4 is basically Settlers 3 Gold if you really consider the two side-by-side.  What we have here with Heritage of Kings is a new game engine, beautiful 3D graphics, awesome combat and heroes with special abilities.  Some say it's comparable to other strategy games, but I beg to differ.  It's Settlers at its heart, just balanced for a more enjoyable experience.  I find this game equally as enjoyable as any of the previous installments.  Maybe more so since it's just a better game.","Settlers, but a different interpretation.",1123545600,24,,

Each time you load up the game you witness a whole new map (each level is randomized) so you never see the same thing in the same spot twice! The graphics and physics of the game are beautifully done. The story line is very good, very in-depth.
Playing by yourself is fun, but when you join a co-op game with 3 others it makes the game 10x better.
The game is very addicting as enemies drop loot-- bigger enemies drop better loot. So, this style of gaming makes you keep slashing because you want better loot etc.
Only thing I have against Diablo 3 would be that they level your characters stats up for you (strength, intelligence, etc.) unlike in Diablo 1 and 2 were you did it yourself. HOWEVER, I believe Blizzard has made it so that when you level up they level up what is best for your character-- so in a way it all works out just fine.

The level of immersion in the Fallout world, the characters, atmosphere etc. is comparable to what GTA USED to be (without the driving of course). Naturally, this world is NOTHING like GTA but the game dynamics are what you would expect from one of the older GTA titles (in other words, the world is huge, the story is great, the game play feels endless and it's crazy addictive). This game will take weeks (maybe months) to complete, so be prepared. It's not an online multiplayer circlejerk like most games have become (thank God).

This is a game for adults who like to be part of a great adventure. You have to have some sort of attention span to enjoy it. Don't worry though, it's not like some of the ridiculous (and completely overdone) Sci-Fi, Fantasy stuff -- it has a very grounded, real world vibe to it that is unique to Fallout. I don't do ""D&D"", ""Space Fantasy"" or ""Anime WTF ever"" stuff at all. This has a touch of Sci-Fi but it didn't get lost in it. It made me feel right at home.

Completing a Fallout game is almost like completing a good novel. It leaves you remembering all of the places you've been and people you've met and it makes you think about all you've experienced.

I got this version within its opening year and this system has never failed me since. Its been running like a champion and is totally compatible with all my PS2 games that i own, WIFI connectivity is there, wired connectivity is there....but the only thing missing are the DualShock 3 controllers. Considered that you can get one with the new 80gig but i highly suggest to people to spend their money on the 60 gig, get urself a dualshock 3 controller and ur way better off this way.

Try finding this version for cheaper and u end up with a great addition to your entertainment system. Im just hoping these guys aren't trying to create a PS4 yet because the current gen systems still have alot more power that can be squeezed out of them......

Simple plot, easy controls, yet if it's well done, it'll blow the most sophisticated games right out of the water in terms of sheer playability. A lot of people lamented the fact that 3D games ment the destruction of this kind of game.
Not so. Here's proof.
This game is about as cutting edge as it can be. It looks amazing, sounds amazing, and has amazing control, flow, and atmosphere. Every one of my friends who has seen the game has commented on how it looks and sounds. The colors are lush, everything looks hand drawn, and there's often little touches that betray the care than went into this game (like individually and carefully placed trees, rocks, and flowers, or small groves that serve no purpose other than just to BE there and add to the feel of the game.) The music seems ripped straight from a Disney film and fits the game PERFECTLY. Rayman's world seems like just that: A WORLD unto itself. Not just the illusion of a world, but an actual, living place. The sheer atmosphere is more prominent than in many RPGs, and everything falls into place perfectly.
At the same time, while the game has amazing depth, it's also quite simple. It is, at it's heart, a simple adventure platform game, and it stays quite true to it's roots. The story is a simple one, but it's engaging. The game makes it easy to figure out what to do next, but doesn't make it easy to accomplish it. In fact, at times the game is rather challenging, but never overly so. Still, younger players may suffer some frustration in the latter half where the game becomes much more unforgiving. Despite this, it isn't really difficult by any means, and anyone who could master the original Super Mario Bros. (among which I'm sure there were a good number of young'ns) will not be defeated by this game. At least not for long. And this game is HUGE, so expect to devote some time to solving it. There will be no finishing this in one sitting. Or two. Or, most likely, ten.
The only gripe is in comparison to the Dreamcast version of the game (which was released first). While this iteration of the game is a superior GAME (it has a better progression, more puzzles and levels, more abilities, and a better sense of cohesion), it lacks a bit when compared to it's predecessor in terms of construction. If you look for it, it's fairly easy to tell that the game wasn't originally designed for the PS2. The framerate is much lower than the DC version (where it blazed along at 60 frames per second). Here, it's more like 20, and it dips well below the 10 range if there is too much action on the screen. While this doesn't detract from the gameplay at all, it IS noticable. And, while Rayman himself looks much better than his DC counterpart, the levels look a bit more jagged in places, and there seems to be less actually going on (butterflies flying around, fish swimming, etc.) Also, it's worth noting that this version is much brighter and more colorful than the DC version. While this can be a good thing in some places (the Lava Sanctuary, with it's bright reds and oranges, look stunning in particular) the game's darker look on the Dreamcast actually worked in it's favor in giving the game a more subtly cool and occasionally sinister tone at times. This is more personal preference, as some areas benefit much more from the added color than they did on the Dreamcast.
If I had to choose which version looked better, I'd have to say the Dreamcast, just by a hair. Still, if I had to pick a version to own, I'd pick this one, hands down. The added features and newfound flow of the game add back tenfold whatever graphical hindrances the game picked up in the transition from one console to another.
This game comes very highly reccomended.","Draws you in -- very, very good!",998265600,,,

I bought this game months ago and played with my friend most of the time in co-op mode. DW3 basically obsoletes the prequel such that it has everything its predecessor had and a whole lot more. The game boasts a myriad of 41 characters while the other game had a mere 28. The storyline is more focused this time around which also caused me to buy the novel (get the 4-volume set if you're planning to buy it since its complete and doesn't leave any plotholes. You can also see my review there). Everything about this game is great from the gameplay, graphics, music, and storyline. One caveat, the english voice acting in the cutscenes are hysterically bad in tandem with the out of sync movement of the lips. One cutscene, I remember has Sun Jian saying: ""So you want to fight me?"" And his mouth stays open...Anyway, if you played the previous game, definitely pick this one up since there's so much more to do. It'll take you no less than 40 hours to get all the weapons (it took me close to 100 hours to get all the weapons and secrets for every character!).

One of the major hurtles for this game is  learning the materia system. The instruction book isn't as clear as it  could be on how it works. Your best bet to understanding it is either  listen to what the people in the game tell you about materia or, even  better, mess around with it. I learned most of the tricks to materia by  going into battle, using my materia, and then changing it and finding  another battle. This not only helps you learn how the materia works but  gives you experience as well.
Another thing about this game is that you  MUST pay attention to the story. I don't know how many times my brother  distracted me and I missed an important part of the story. And because the  plot is so complicated, going for a long time without playing is not  recommended because you tend to forget small things that end up becoming  big things later in the story.

I enjoyed the fact that in this new version not only do the armies of different nations have specialized weaponry, but I also liked the fact that the civilizations have different strengths: the Dutch make money quickly because of their banks, the British automatically increase their population with every ""manor"" they build, etc. I also liked the ""deck"" concept which you can manipulate (a little) to improve your settlement. The graphics are splendid, even if the proportions of humans and inanimate objects (like houses and ships) are wildly out of scale. (But they were that way in AEII also. This is a forgivable matter of visual logistics, however.)

There are mild taunts from your enemies before play begins and sometimes during battles to give you a chuckle. The wild card element of Native Americans and Trading Posts are another added dimension that can be tempting diversions or distractions.

After playing through half of the missions, it didn't disappoint! The two analog sticks makes playing the game like on regular console, although I'm a bit slow to touch the screen to go over the barricade or toggling zoom of the gun's target scope. The graphics are impressive on a small screen. I'm really surprised to see smoke or fog moving in open areas. That's a testament to including advanced software logic, as well as such powerful portable console. The sound is very good. With a very good headset, I can hear solders talking and whispering (softly) on one or the other ear.

There are 36 missions that will get unlocked in sequence when previous mission is completed. Sometimes other missions will get unlocked as well. The maps get re-used for different missions. Personal score is compared to those in the area, region, and global. For each mission I was encouraged to replay, get better, and move on to next level within the mission. It suggests best personnel for each mission, but I'm free to choose the character I want. The length of each mission is short enough where I can, at any time, take out Vita to play a bit. It's a nice alternative to the simple games found on smartphones (iPhone, Android).  So to me it has high replay value on a day-to-day basis.

The online co-op allows me to either join in or create a public/private co-op, but I haven't had a chance to try. Same with high value targets. Will update this review when I spend sufficient time with them.

Assassin's Creed combines Splinter Cell and Prince of Persia to create one of the most amazing action games I have ever played.  Most of the technology in this game is top-notch.  As a rock climber myself, the climbing in this game hits a sweet spot for me.  It's pretty impressive how realistically they implemented it.  It's definitely one of the best parts of this game.

The combat has been criticized as being an endless string of counters.  Well you can make it that way if you want -- waiting around to counter -- or you can make it interesting and actually go after guys.  Either way, I find it to be fun, original combat system that adds greatly to the game.

Another new feature that is very Prince of Persia-esque is the ""free-run"" system.  Basically, Altair can run over any obstacle.  It's so fluid and easy to do that the issue isn't a matter of control.  It's a matter of which way are you going to go, and how hard do you want it to be to get there.  It's very fun.

5.0,True,"07 18, 2012",A15JPYV0L19RF,B00309XHD0,RJ the Great Cat Lover,"Just finished this game. What a ride! This is one heck of a game. I had a lot of fun with this game, even though I purchased it a year ago. I wanted to wait until the time was right to play it. I played the first game and loved it, as well. DS1 was one of my first shooter games on the PS3, and Number Two is just as good if not better.

Graphically, Dead Space 2 is outstanding. Like its predescessor, the graphics are top-notch, with great detail. The videos are seemlessly integrated into the game. When a video kicks in, the graphical detail is the same as the game, which means the game itself is high-quality graphics.

The game is gory, make no mistake about it. Grotesque, even. The monsters spew forth guts and blood and, er, stuff, when they are defeated. Very cool!

I found screen brightness to be a minor issue in my game. At first, I did as directed and the screen setting was way too dark. After I maximized the brightness setting I had perfect resolution.

The sound is amazing. This game should be played with headphones on, so you can hear every bit of sound clearly. The music sets the atmosphere just right for a Horror title, and the sounds of the creepies crawling near you help set the tone as well. The voice acting is excellent. The actors played their parts extremely well, and that is a good thing as it helps the story only so much better.

The story itself evolves nicely as you progress through the battles and tasks. Unlike the first game, Dead Space 2 does not have all that many chapter-ending bosses. This was done very well in the first game. Instead, Dead Space 2 has story evolvement and tasks that must be accomplished. There are also no arcade sequences as found in the first game. I really did get involved in the story. This time around, Isaac Clarke, the main character, has a voice and a face. The story is very involving, as characters grow and go through a journey as they say. I kept asking myself, ""Who is going to make it? And, who is going to die?"" The story is good all the way to the end.

Furthermore, I recommend playing Dead Space 1 before Dead Space 2. Although the second game has slightly improved graphical detail, the first game is very solid. There are flashback moments in the second game that will ruin your playthrough of the first game if you skip Dead Space 1. Both games have almost the same combat smoothness in a game, making both of these games awesome shooters.

The Dead Space games have a sort of RPG element in that equipment can be upgraded. Power nodes are dispersed throughout the levels and allow equipment upgrades. Guns, tools and suits can all be upgraded nicely to get that 'extra edge' over the monsters. There is also an inventory. As you play, you will find items that can be used or sold. By the way, ALWAYS keep one power node in your inventory! This will allow you to open Node Locked doors and find secret rooms where cool items are found. These items may by ammo or healing kits, but you will also find schematics for new items (redeemable at the store), as well as items that have a higher value. (The store, workbench, and save points are placed throughout the game at various points.) Anyway, this upgrade feature really makes Dead Space fun!

My first playthrough was on Normal mode. I have slow reflexes, however, and I died often. I died in every decent battle, as a matter of fact. I was always low on credits, healing, and ammunition. Although I like a challenge now and then, I was not having much fun. So, I changed the difficulty to Casual mode and ... still died! A few times, anyway. I had a LOT of fun after that.

The game has all sorts of difficulty settings. For example, there is newgame+, which allows the player to take their upgraded items into the next game. I had fun on the setting I played on.

Although I usually detest Healing Kits in a game, and greatly prefer Auto-Healing in a shooter, the game design for Dead Space makes healing kits work. Most of the enemies will try to close the range and melee the main character. Meanwhile, the main character has more than enough tools to keep the baddies away. It works well.

As far as guns go, I used the Plasma Cutter and the Pulse Rifle within the game. I like the Plasma Cutter because, once upgraded, it hits really hard and is excellent for limb dismemberment. The Pulse Rifle, on the other hand, is an assault rifle and has a very high rate of fire. Necromorphs will get knocked back a little when hit with most any gun/tool, and I love assault rifles!

I played for 1-2 hours at a time, then I would recharge my wireless equipment. Dead Space 1 and 2 are both games that has a player on the edge of their seat, wondering what will happen next. My nerves would be shaken. As I rested, I would reflect on what had happened and the story progression. When I was ready for more I'd dive back in. Dead Space 2 takes around 15 hours or so to play for the most part, so it took me about a week to get through.

The only bad thing about this game? It ends!

This is an excellent game. Graphics, sound and story, combined with excellent gameplay, make for one heck of an experiance. Dead Space 2 has some of the best entertainment found in video games today.

Hope this helps.

Good Luck, and Good Hunting!

The online mode is the coolest thing I have ever seen. The headset works perfectly and really helps you out during the online missions. One of the problems with Quake and such is that there was really no good way to talk to your teammates. Being able to talk in real time with you team members in SOCOM totally fixes that problem.
The controls on the game are a bit hard to get used to and they seem to be in a funky lay out at first. I am used to the X button as the fire button. However SOCOM uses the R1 button. Keep in mind, this is the Default setup. The controls actually are laid out extremely well I have found.
I never have been and never will be the best player in the world, but apparently there are a lot of others in that same boat. There are plenty of newbie rooms on the SOCOM servers, and for the most part you will find everyone is helpful and will offer some really good suggestions. This just makes it better, in my book.
I have noticed a few server problems though - it usually takes me two or three attempts to log on to them. Once I am logged on I stay logged on. This is most likely a NAT issue and I don't have the proper ports open on my firewall.

PRESENTATION -

~~~~Single Player = The beauty of this game really doesnt lie in the single player aspect... Lots of missions (surprisingly varied, yet have the feel of milk runs), different locations (not too well developed though...), force power depth, and... DRUMROLL... Cool lightsaber customization!... To be honest i never really finished SP because it took forever.... I went straight to MP!

~~~~Multi Player = Now THIS is where it gets good! You can go to many different maps and planets and play about 6 different modes of your choice; like Duel, Siege, etc.! You can distribute force points and use those powers and your saber (not to mention weapons too!) and defeat the enemies or capture the flag OR maybe complete an objective and win the battle. Its your choice! THIS is where the game shines and really gives you the replay value you look for.

SOUND AND VOICE -
  Kinda awkward... Enemies spit out the same little taunts after you just killed all their friends... Music is fine for a while but its kinda forgettable... good for the mood though

STORY -
  Cutscenes are just alright... story is pretty good of what ive seen... except that the main character you play for seems not very tied into the main focus at all... he seems to just want to get through all his missions and graduate Jedi school...

CHARACTERS -

~~~~Movements = Ehh... they're all right; the saber shoves and swipes are really great, but the jumping and little things need a bit of work

PROS -
*Create your own character in SP and MP!
*Go to jediknight3.filefront.com to get extra maps or new characters for MP and additions to SP!
*Interesting saber styles (Staff, Double, Single)
*Great action (especially in MP!)

CONS -
*Exhausted looking engine of graphics (not much detail)
*Less involvement in the story as its predecessor (Jedi Outcast)

What strikes me as impressive for this collection is that it contains a wide variety of material, so even if you absolutely hate a game or genre on this system, you are probably going to thoroughly enjoy others.  There are other fun things trying all these games out - seeing the difference between some of the earlier genesis games to the later ones.  Just look at the graphics with phantasy star 2 compared to phantasy star 4, for example.
If you do not like spending the time and energy on RPGs, that is something to consider before buying this.  But, there is still plenty to enjoy ignoring the phantasy star collection, especially for a retail price of 20 bucks.
Overall, the graphics and gameplay have held up well - these are mostly 16 bit games, so a jump ahead from NES fare.

5.0,False,"02 15, 2004",AX8SWWB9837TA,B00005NZ1G,Chris Peters,"There are only 2 great console first-person shooters, Goldeneye 64, and Halo.  Before I bought Halo, I couldn't see what the big fuss is about, but now I do - Halo is the Real Deal, a true Classic that you will play endlessly and fondly remember years from now.  With a huge and engaging single-player mode, a worthwhile co-op mode, 16 player multiplay that's as effortless as plugging a cord, great graphics and controls that fit like a glove, Halo holds its own against any FPS game on the PC.
The essense of Halo is playing with other people.  Even in the first stages of the single player game, you are fighting alongside your fellow shipmates and marines.  Your buddies call out to each other and cover one another, and so do the bad guys.  It's cool to jump into a jeep or tank and see friends climb into the turrets and hang on the sides, turning the vehicle into a moble fortress.  At the times when you truly go solo, like infiltration missions or whatnot, you really do feel alone, sometimes like you're a one-man army and sometimes like the entire world is falling apart on top of your head.
The story and the setting are very cool - you crash land on a giant ring-world of an ancient dead civilization, with structures and settings that are absolutely enormous, sometimes miles across.  I liked the ramp-up in difficulty, moving from large coordinated attacks to one-man army raids and on to thrilling moments when all you can do is clear a path to run through, because you're scared to death of what's behind you.  My only complaint is that some locations are recycled too often, and it seems that I revisited everything twice.
Co-op is wonderful!  Somehow Microsoft made it seem as if they customized the game for co-op mode, without losing anything by playing in single-player mode.  Most FPS co-op is frustrating, as you struggle against enemies and situations designed for 1 person, not 2.  The maps are usually too small, and the enemies and weapons are too few.  Since Halo already has other good guys fighting in the game, the 2nd player is really just adding some intelligence to one of your buddies. It's so much fun I finished the game with a friend before I ever played it alone.
Once you're bored with the story, you'll find some of the best multiplay modes I've ever seen.  You can connect 4 Xboxes with 4 players each, for 16 player mayhem.  The setup is effortless (it uses 10/100 ethernet cords and hubs, the same as your computer).  Game types include deathmatch and team deathmatch, capture the flag, hot bag, king of the hill, assault, racing and rally, and on and on.  Plenty of custom options, like unlimited grenades and all-player invisiblity keep things constantly changing.  One complaint about multiplayer (my 2nd and last complaint about hte entire game) is that there aren't enough maps to play on, and most of those maps are of the boxed-in maze type.
If you own an Xbox, You should own this game.","Believe it, Halo is an All-Time Classic",1076803200,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

You play as Leon going to an island in Europe to find the missing US president's daughter. On the way to search for her you discover that the people int the towns of the island have been transformed into intelligent humanoid killing machines, they are not zombies since they are alive yet they act like it. They are very intelligent when they are after you, they will mostly scare the begeezus out of you. Anyway, you find out a man named saddler is behind it, he also has a little french midgit son named salazar who is so damn annoying (i hate his little french voice!!!). LOL, but the enemies are sort of in the middle range of difficulty, bosses are quite easy since each boss battle has a hint of defeating them. Yet, I have some warnings and some hints on how to defear numerous foes throughout the game... oh yes there are also chainsaw people HEHE...

Warnings n Tips: 1. always go cautiously around a corner and have your gun ready since you do not know what can be around it (trust me i ran around a corner and a chainsaw guy slashed my head off, it scared the hell out of me.)

2. always reload guns before going into a room your not sure of and usually just reload them anyway just to be safe.

3. When in a boss battle, always look around for a clue or item that could be lying around. This could save your a$$ in a battle.

4. If you are getting surrounded by numerous foes, always remember to get a strong gun that will take them all down in a blast (i recommened buying the shotgun ASAP from the merchant, you will defnitely need it later on.)

5. Dont get cocky and start blasting all around hitting all guys up close, let them come to you and if they throw a weapon at you, run real quick. (you can tell when they throw a weapon when they raise their weapon over their head.)

6. Always try to shoot your foes in the legs so it will bring them to the ground, them blast them in the head to get a easier kill. Oh yes and when a parasite comes out shoot it without mercy!!!

7. LAST AND MOST IMPORTANT, TRY AND CONSERVE AMMO, MONEY, AND HEALTH ITEMS UNTIL EMERGENCIES ONLY!! try to keep up your amounts of ammo and health so you can use them later on when you will possibly need it. Plus, try to save money up so you can upgrade your weapons and stuff, also try to save at least 30000 gold points so you can buy a rocket launcher from the merchant for bigger boss battles.

I don't like to write long reviews as I think those can kind of defeat the purpose of giving someone a quick overview of the game also my reviews tend to be a bit disorganized and I apologize I just like to talk about items I like in the game instead of talking about sound, graphics, controls, etc.

 The game has you taking the role of two separate duos one being the main character of the game who's name is Delta and the other a robot guardian by the name of ""Earthes"" that is controlled by you the player. Earthes is a character that allows you to interact more with the Ar world as you sometimes get more than one choice of how Earthes responds to the other players which I thought was very unique as some of the responses are humorous. Once you progress in the game you have to ""zap"" back and forth between Earthes and Delta's parties when you become stuck with one to move the story along. The overall game play is very similar to the other Ar games if you have played them, basically in all the Ar games you have a female character that performs ""Song Magic"" which is extremely powerful, while she is singing your main characters protect her and deals out physical damage. One difference in battles is they are back to being turn based and now the enemies come in ""waves""  meaning when you clear out one group of enemies the next wave appears. The better you fight you build up a burst gauge that powers up your song magic allowing you to activate the song and destroy multiple waves of enemies.. getting you a higher battle rank with better bonuses the most I've taken down is about 10 waves so far 3 earning an A rank I've yet to get an S rank yet. The game has plenty of story interaction between the characters as well with of course the return of diving where the main character dives into the heroines' minds to weave stronger song magic. These dives can be a bit unique so be prepared for a bit of a surprise when you start diving if you are new to the series after all you are viewing the innermost secret of a person's heart. The game also has the return of synthesis where you can create powerful items to equip or use in battle which is enjoyable as I like gathering ingredients to make new items which are then available for you to buy and use (those who have played other gust games like the Atelier series will know all about this). There are many other features but I'd rather not spoil everything. To wrap up I'd say the biggest thing about the Ar games that can throw people off is they can tend to be a bit slow when you start them but believe me they do get better the longer you play them so you have to have patience. I haven't played far into the game but have enjoyed it thus far. I do hope this game is received well so we can expect more games in the Ar series.

Please note that this is not a simulation racer like (ie, Gran Tourismo or Nascar). Burnout 3 is of course the sequel to Burnout 2. You race against computer or human opponents on freeways and city streets filled with regular street traffic. You and your rivals are dodging other cars or even drive against traffic when you go the the wrong way! Its actually even better to go the wrong way because when you avoid collisions, you'll be rewarded with boost meter. You can play several modes: Race (standard race), Time trials (beat the clock), World tournaments (race in other countries), Crash mode (cause car accident chain reactions) and a new feature called Road rage (awesome). Crash mode returns and to help you create more devestating accidents, they included powerups to help increase your score and destruction: some maps have money pick-ups, speed boost, multiplyer, and explosives. You can now activate super slow motion and guide your car in mid-air called ""impact time"" to targets. Your vehicle also acts as a bomb. If you press detonate, it will explode to cause more damage to the already lethal car accidents; and remember that this is happens in super slow motion and looks fantastic. In Road Rage mode you are trying to push your rivals off the road or cause them to crash while traveling at blazing speeds; hence the name ""takedown"". When you collect enough points you can unlock new, tracks, cars, and lots of other goodies. The sense of speed in this game is incredible!
Why bother buying other racers? Burnout 3 is the best there is! Many people have thanked me for recommending this game to them. But the real thanks should go to the creators for making this MASTERPIECE! Thank you! Thank you very much!

I wasn't expecting much when it came to ALB, I expected pretty much the same, wow, was I wrong. This game has depth in spades, with the amount of nations and units available, it's simply amazing. I don't play online, I bought this game to play against the AI and I must say no two games are alike. You have tremendous strategy to employ, a feature that a lot of new RTS games are missing is the ability direct you AI partner, i.e., toss a flare down and ask for aid and they will send forces to your rescue. I loved this aspect in the last Red Alert, though the expansion for it removed this aspect, completely ruining a lot of the experience IMO. Simply put, this game is exceptional - I can't say enough good things about it. If you are a fan of modern warfare or you like large scale games such as Total Annihilation or the original Supreme Commander, you no doubt will highly enjoy this game. My only thing I would like to see change is balancing the nations and improving the overall sound quality. Nothing wrong with the sound, for the most part it's incredible, though I would like to see less compression and purer audio quality.

I would like to see a paid expansion possibly bringing in the last 20 years of technology and/or Asian Countries - maybe, ""Asian Escalation"" North & South Korea, China, Japan, India etc. The NATO and PACT weapons are from late 1950's until around 1991 or so (Cold War), would like to see this expanded to present day.

These people are mad that an apple doesn't peel as well as an orange.  Let's get this straight......this is an online game.  If you want to play with yourself or alone in the room with your friend, then get a DIFFERENT GAME.

Now, onto why this game is great.

--  The gameplay is tight.  It's polished for shooter.  Its also clear that they are actively working on the gameplay and rebalancing things as time goes on (this is good!).

--  The servers work good.  No complaints.

--  It's like TF2 in that you can play how you want to play.  Want to grind up the middle and mow down the other side?  Want to play in a support role -- healing, air support or teleporters?  Want to snipe from a distance?  You can, and with each strength you have a weakness.

--  The sub-classes add another layer of nuance.  Getting tired of a certain class?  Use one of the sub classes you unlocked for a slight change that allows you to rework your style of play..

--  Having two sides forces you to change up play style.

--  It's lighthearted.  Again, this is like TF2 -- and it makes the game fun, even if you are losing.

--  It's addictive.  You earn points, points buys stickers and stickers unlock new things.  Keep tapping that button and you get more pellets.....it's Pavlovian and it's a big part of what makes games fun.  Constant rewards.

-- FREE DLC.  So far all the DLC has been free, and it has been worthwhile stuff.  Let's hope they keep this up.",Best class based shooter since Team Fortress 2.  No joke -- it's that good.,1398297600,18,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
5.0,True,"11 21, 2014",A1KFA1VSISNOZT,B002I096Q4,Artesian,"Destiny is an impressive title that blends genres never before combined with any sort of quality or attention to detail. This is a trend-setter of a game and one that will go down in history as an important step for FPS/MMOs.

I've ""beaten"" the game as of the date of this review, and every bit of the experience was beautiful (except material farming, that was annoying). I have 3 max-geared level 30 characters, 1 of each class, and I've seen every little nook and cranny of the game. I've beaten the vault dozens of times on both modes, acquired almost every exotic item, destroyed my foes in Iron Banner, and done silly errands for the Awoken Queen.

The Vault of Glass is really something to behold and I encourage all players to level up and get through the adventure at least once. I hope the next raids have something else amazing in store.

Common complaints about the title are minor but seldom personal. Some usability oversights can be explained by testers not putting in the hundreds of hours with highly motivated players required to get the very best of items and use them to maximum advantage. The lack of vault space is deplorable, but makes sense if you only have one character at a high level. True mastery of the game was likely not expected for most players. The original five bounty slots have been upgraded to 10, which is great and needed to happen from the first week onward.

The planetary worlds are massive and fun to explore, although they become repetitive after just a week or two of adventuring. The story is almost non-existent and I blame Activision for this - not Bungie. Hopefully we'll see expansions that fill in the gaps and expand on the groundwork laid out.

5.0,False,"07 28, 2014",A3FEQXNCFC68KC,B00007JZB3,SRFireside,"Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed the movie Tron: Legacy very much. Great story, soundtrack and world design. However it didn't feel like Tron so much as a futuristic world set in neon. If you really want to get the ""user digitized inside a computer"" experience Tron 2.0 is where it's at. It's set like a sequel to the movie with the dude who wrote the original Tron program, Alan (Bruce Boxleitner), gets captures into the computer world and it's up to his son Jet to get him out. From there you get an amazing first person shooter game that looks like no other.

This game's absolute biggest claim to fame is the look and feel of the digitized world. If you ever saw the original Tron movie and loved seeing that universe that was created then that alone is enough to play this game. The setting is simply fantastic. From the neon lighting (all over the place!) to the geometric landscapes. This game just oozes the atmosphere of the movie, only to a much more heightened level. Monolith developed the game using it's latest Lithtech engine at that time. That engine really knew how to maximize the use of lighting to great effect. The music was also very reminiscent of the original movie, with an analog and mathematical feel to it while still sounding melodic and ambient.

Gameplay is pretty linear, which is standard far for most FPS games. As far as weapons are concerned you start with the iconic ID disc, now updated to look much cooler than just being a frizbie with lines. From there you can accumulate ""upgrades"" to get your standard shotgun, sniper rifle and autofiring rifle. I still found that most of the time your disc works best, but the other weapons do become pretty useful. Weapons aren't the only upgrades you get. Jet can upgrade himself to Jet 1.1 and so on. With these upgrades he can add subroutines of varying levels (Alpha, Beta and Gold similar software releases these days). This makes for an RPG type experience leveling up your player.

What makes the game really fun is that there are lots of references relating to computers, and you can see just how they interact in this computer world. The names of other programs (NPCs) have extensions like .exe, and .dll. The more nasty opponents are viruses that can much up the environment as well as your health. Jet would have to defragment or repair infected subroutines when that happens. There is also one level where you have to outrun a disk format, which is portrayed as this invincible wall destroying everything as it moves closer. If you have any experience with working on a computer in a more in depth level there is lots of little details to enjoy here.

Another feather in the game's cap was the return of talents from the original Tron movie. Bruce Boxleitner and Cindy Morgan handle voice characterizations with Bruce reprising his role as Alan Bradley. Sid Mead, the conceptual designer for the original, did several sketches for the light cycle back in the day. With Tron 2.0 you get to see one of his original designs come to life in the most spectacular way (and you get to ride this original, yet new, light cycle). Did I forget to mention that? You get to ride two kinds of light cycles (both new and old) in a classic ""don't hit the jet walls"" match.

According to the creator of the original Tron, Steven Lisberger, Tron 2.0 is an official sequel to the 1982 film. Then Tron: Legacy came out and made things confusing on the ""official"" front. Still this game is much truer to the original material than the movie. If you loved the old movie you will absolutely go ape for this game. If you liked the aesthetics of either of the Tron movies this game will really impress you visually.

Those of us who have been with Link since the old school days of ""The Legend of Zelda"" really appreciated this one when it came out.  The graphics were intense the plot was deep, and there were so many new things to find.  A person could immerse themselves in this game for hours and even days on end without stopping to eat, sleep, or use the bathroom (yes that was me, well almost).  I remeber the countless hours I spent finding heart containers, weapons, and other things in this game, along with all of the good memories that it brought as well.

After all I've seen I can easily say that this is the most important game of 2003.2004 and possbley 2005 for the home consoles and I'm just glad I'm an xbox fan and own one of these remarkable machines.
Now I totaly agree with every word of the previous reviews on this site before me, well spoken guys.
Now I was on a few site ( pro playstaion) and they claim there "" killzone"" game is a Halo killer! lol, I highly doubt that , hell I don't even think it will come close to Halo 1. Sure Killzone looks pretty good....pretty good for a PSpoo game that is.
And all the people that don't have an xbox or halo 1 and are saying halo 2 sucks and is the same as Halo 1 are obviously just envious that there weak systems cant handle the raw power needed to play heavy hitting games like Halo 2, Doom 3, Jade Empire, Splinter cell 3 chaos theory,the new Unnreal tournament etc., that xbox was built to handle.
I personaly sold my ps2 the first year xbox came out because I couldn't stand ps2's crappy games and to many problems it has like disc read error and freezing, extreamily long load times, MEMORY CARDS!!!,etc. Sure its got some alright exclusives, that is if your a final fantasy junkie like I'm NOT I don't mind rachet and clank to much though.than you'll want a ps2
If you like washed up plummers and kiddish looking games, and enjoy mass amounts of text reading were other systems can handle voice over and NO online play except ONE game! than Lamecube is for you. Now Gamecube also has a few good exclusives like Mario cart some res evils wich are outdated, except res 4 looks realy cool since after almost 10 years they finaly listened to fans and got rid of there terrible camera angles. But to realy put the nail in the coffin its not even a game cube exclusive anymore because there porting it to ps2 haha.
So if you like online play there's nothing better for consoles than xbox live, if you like large game selections designed for the more mature gamer theres none better than xbox, if you like to have 90% of the best games exclusive to your system there none better than xbox.also NO MEMORY CARDS NEEDED!! and if you don't like the music offered in many games, no problem just download your favorite CD's to your xbox harddrive and vwallla your listening to your prefered music on some of your fav games.
Now it may sound like Im bashing ps2 and gamecube but I'm just telling it like I see it and from starting out with the ps2 ( wich I regret) I am now a loyal xbox fan and owner to this day and 2004-2005 to possibly 2006 until X2 is released to the world the next gen console wras are going to get allot closer baby in the numers I'm almost positive in that we might even see Xbox take the #1 spot.wwwwooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
these our going to be our best years for top noch games for our large and in charge black and green machines and so many xbox exclusives your going to have to MAKE time in your social life to acomidate all these killer titles coming out soon.

Rayman 2: The Great Escape is the sequel to the original Playstation game Rayman. In this adventure, Rayman has been captured by an army of robotic pirates who are conquering the world. After a narrow escape, Rayman is charged with finding an all powerful being named Polkus who can stop the pirates' conquest. Now, it is once again up to Rayman to rescue the captured people and save the world.
The biggest change is the transition from 2D to 3D gameplay. The game is a third person platformer with simple and tight controls. Rayman can use his hair as a chopper propeller to glide down rather than fall which can be a life saving move. The combat is very well implemented. By pressing the left trigger the camera centers behind Rayman and if an enemy is present you will lock on to them. Rayman attacks by shooting energy from his hand, which is upgraded over the course of the game. Part of the game if collecting the 1000 yellow Lums scattered across the levels. Finding these Lums allows you to access the later levels and unlocks entries in an in-game log that expands on the game's backstory. Some of the Lums are found in cages which are littered throughout the game, 80 in total. For every ten cages your health bar is extended. Finding all the Lums and cages in any given level grants a bonus game where you can win attack upgrades though they are only temporary. The game has great flow that makes each level very fun to play through.

As stated before, Rayman 2 was ported to may consoles. Although it was originally released on the N64, a good version in it's own right, it was later re-released to the PC which started the long line of ports and remakes. The Dreamcast version is the closest to the PC version in terms of graphics and sound quality. It also upped the framerate to a smooth 60 FPS. Although the Playstation version is largely the same and contains a hidden tech demo of the original Rayman 2 Beta, the PS version suffers long load times and a severe drop in graphical quality. The Playstation 2 had the game Rayman 2: Revolution which is an extreme overhaul of the original game.

I have all settings maxed out and the game is very nice and smooth.  I even have under the minimum requirement cpu but my gfx card is decent even though it is a few years old now.  If you don't have a good gfx card this game is very slow/buggy like on my brother's computer.  He has to have it set to the lowest gfx settings and it still crawls and is near unplayable.  This however is not the case at all if you have a good gfx card.

My system is outdated but is still barely good enough to run this game at high settings.  I have an AMD 64 3000 with 1 gig memory and a Nvidia 7800 gfx card but my card is an AGP card so it is way slower than a PCI Express 7800 card.

For all you negative posters, it is time to upgrade your card and I would have to say most of your view points are an issue of your gfx card not being fast enough and not with this awesome game.  When I first bought Oblivion I could not play it at all, totally unplayable with my crappy gfx card so I upgraded my card and was able to play just fine.  I suggest you do the same for this game if you are having problems.

This is by far the best game I have played and blows Oblivion out of the water in every catagory.  My character is level 35 and I have explored about 60% of the game content at this point.  I have never played a game that made me feel like I was in the world as much as this game does.  I have never once got stuck in the world or on terrian or seen any of the bugs that others with crappy gfx cards have reported.

The only bugs I have ran into is a display bug on a potion that says it increases endurance when it really increases life force and I do sometimes have to save/quit the game and reboot my machine because the screen will bog down (probably a slow memory leak) but other than that minor problem which I am sure will be patched soon, this game is near perfect and the most fun I have ever had in RPG games.  I have played near everyone since Ultima 3 on the Amiga computer as well.

Bottomline is that if you have a good gfx card this game is the best ever, if not it will be very hard to play it if at all.",This game is awesome if you have a good gfx card,1164672000,15,,

Not going to lie about that.  You will die.  A lot!  Certain boards do not work well with the controller man.  The game was so darn good, I just got over that, with some yelling of course at certain junctures of the game.  The game is hard. You will have ample opportunities to level up (1up), and you will need it.  It's Mario.  So  there's definitely the death defying jumps, slips, falls, all to your death.

This game is unique, and you can use a slew of different abilities which I think they did a fantastic job with.  The Cat Mario, boomerang Mario, Raccoon Mario, propeller Mario, and of course fire Mario.  I bought this game brand new, and it wasn't cheap!  But it was sure as heck worth it.  I'm almost sad I beat it, but you know what, it has replay value.  And at some point I will return to it again.  Many stamps and stars and other challenging to keep you occupied beyond the ending.

Oh yeah, did I mention how pristine and lovely this game looks!!  It doesn't get any better.  I'm serious.  The game is a beautiful work of art.  This game took me way back to my roots, to super Mario bros. on the original nes.  This game was just as fun as if I took a time machine back to the 80's during my elementary years junior high years.  This game will be a classic, I can see that already.  I'll probably never sell it, to be honest with you.  Unless I fell on some really hard times.  Other then that, at this point in time, it's ageless.

The challenge factor is there.  Like I said the controls on certain levels are very annoying and frustrating.  You will yell, but you won't throw that expensive tablet I can assure you.  At least I hope you don't.  Remember it is just game.  A great one at that.",Instant Classic Mario.  Ha Ha!!!,1451433600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Instead, this is a versus title putting your characters against another marvel character or, one of the new Imperfects (as the game creators call them) The imperfects are not that bad and some of them are very interesting character. However, the game's story falls short. You'll spend more time fighting enemies that repeatedly appear on every stage until a boss fight against one of the Imperfects. The good about this title is that you will get the chance to play as marvel characters you rarely get to play as.

There are numerous games for kids to play and the game adjust quite well to all skill levels and ages.  The games require a wide range of activities working the legs and arms, but also work on basic balance skills.  The Mine Shaft game, for instance, requires that you stand on one foot and then the other while moving your arms up and down.  But, there are also basic run and jump maneuvers in other games.  Something for everyone.

Maybe its the fact that the graphics are slopped together to the point where you kinda think they're kidding around. The people off the city are all freaks, and you and they make all sorts of real noises. The noises the pilot makes when you walk towards water or near the edge of a buidling are hilarious.

Even though, there's not really ALL that much to do in these cities, you probably won't notice it too much. All the stuff is pretty fun. You get to put out fires, rescue people, chase down speeders, etc. A fun little thing is that when you transport people, if you start to descend as fast as you can, the little displays of them in your chopper show them getting all flustered and scared.

Call of Duty Black Ops was pretty fun to play online.  Me and one of my friends would sit down and have some EPIC CTF (Capture the Flag) battles online.  Then we would do Zombies.  Call of Duty Black Ops is based in the Cold War so the maps are going to be in Veitnam and Cuba.  My favorite perk in Second Chance/Last Stand.  Call of Duty Black Ops ll kicks butt!  Online is fun, but lots of different weapon attachments making it harder or worse than Black Ops.  We tend to do local fighting bots with one of my other friends.  We play on CTF and make it so the flag can't be returned.  Then we put it in the middle of the map and we jump off of a ledge or something and do a 360 spin w/snipers and try to either no-scope (not looking through the scope, but killing the guy) or quick-scope (looking through the scope, but shooting and not looking through the scope to and killing the guy.).

5.0,False,"06 2, 2007",A393VTXSFYGMYZ,B000FJSIUA,Live Player,"Im a huge fan of thq games. Also RTS is my favorite type of game(real time strategy). Ive played alot form command and conquer 1, through dawn of war(all of them). Im running Vista now with a new PC and was happy to see that there were no compatibility issues; i didn't even have to install the first patch. It ran right after installing perfectly fine. One thing I do suggest that you have a decently powerful pc, at least a 256MB graphics card, 2ghz processor, and 1gb of ram 2 is better.

Not only are the graphics unreal and the fighting fast and intense, the possibilities are endless via that everything is destructible. EX. Wall in your way no problem, take your 82nd airborne troops and have them throw a satchel charge at it, problem solved. One of my favorite things to do is to zoom in over the shoulder of one of my snipers as he takes down unfriendlies. The explosions are realistic, and the sound is also stunning, from gunfire to hearing one of your squads cursing at eachother as they run through a hail of gunfire,(dammit johnson i thought i f'in told you to tie your laces!) Plenty of cursing at the enemy too.

One of the great things about the game is in multiplayer; be it skirmish or online, the two sides are very different. For example the german pioneers are lb for lb stringer than the american combat engineers, although the amrican engineers can set demo on bridges and buildings to destroy them while the pioneers cant. Also the system of building while the americans can generally build all their buildings from the start, the germans have to research escalation at their hq to build some more advanced buildings. Also in veterancy the americans gain it by causing casulties to the enemy or by setting traps and etc., where as the germans have to research veterancy at their base.

One gripe is the realism on the tanks, the most powerful tank of ww2 was the tiger. Another powerful tank is the panther, and youll see american shermans going toe to toe with a panther, in realism definately wouldnt happen, alot of sherman tanks couldn't even penetrate the armour of a tiger and some panthers. Also sometimes when you order more than one vehicle unit to move sometimes they run into eachother, but other than that' great game.

If you're new to the franchise, it's never been easier to start, with multiple control schemes, choice of automatic or manual steering, difficulty levels, and a huge number of vehicles, characters, and tracks. If you're a veteran, I'd still recommend it for the sheer volume of content and new things such as bikes, tricks, and more racers per race (12).

There are some things that might trouble some veterans, however. Most notable is how swingy the items can really make the game, easilly causing a shift of several places one way or the other with the use of a single item. There are also many attacks which can hit opponents wherever they might be, and there is no practical way to protect yourself against many of these. This can be frustrating. There is also no multiplayer GP mode, although with versus you can pretty much make your own GP mode, and there's even a new team mode.

It's a good anime style game, reminds me a lot of Fear Effect for the PSX, but its definitly better. The graphics are pretty good, and the controls can be a bit annoying at first, but when you get use to them you realize that every game should have this control system. By giving full functionality to both analog sticks you have complete (and easy) control over your whole environment. The only time i get into trouble with the controls is when i get jumped by about 3 enemy soldiers, which if i was smarter the first time around i would have been able to take them all out one by one.
There are some great characteristics to this game. The enemies in the game are very 'smart'. You are only allowed to carry one gun, so choose it wisely. And ammo is not so greatly in abundance. Which is all nice because it helps add realism to the game. Well, as much realism as an anime taking place in 2032 can be.

Just like the switch from Monument Valley to Pacific Rift, the driving feel has been tweaked a little from what veterans of the previous title are used to. This is not just the old PR engine cut and pasted into an concrete jungle, the driving will take a little getting used to, and at first I was not impressed. It is possible to get used to it though, and you'll be flying around tracks faster and more effectively then you ever were in PR after a little practice. In fact I actually used to hate rally cars, now I can control them better, I guess they are a little less...randomly floaty? It's likely the handling is off a bit from PR becuase of the new perks system in which you race online to earn more then just rank, you earn vehicle upgrades both mechanical and cosmetic. In fact online IS the game now, and Single-Player Festival can be completely ignored as it does not unlock anything! (except a few extras about the new motion comic storyline and an even harder difficulty).
For me it wasn't really worth nearly ripping my controller in half just to face the cheap and cheaper AI, whose primary goal was not that they'll win, but that you won't. They constantly slam you, ""accidentally"" bump your back tire, or in some way destabilize you to run into something, sometimes [by the veteran class] even teaming up to ""accidentally"" knock you out. You would have thought the city falling down around you would be challenge enough, I felt that the cheap AI was annoying and unnecessary. I also could have done without the stupid rebels (peds) that throw molotovs and shoot machine guns and rockets at you, overheating you and then grab on to you car when you go by.

-Tracks-
If you want to play the circuits without other people distracting you or without the track interactively rising and falling around you, there is still a time trial mode with all the circuit tracks from festival unlocked from the start. A few tracks from the festival are not present in that mode simply becuase they don't loop (Such as the first city track people saw in the preview video from E3 2010). There are 8 track regions based on areas from San Fransisco and each region has about 3 circuit routes taking place at different times in the destruction. The routes laid out are a mix of awesome and terrible. If you remember getting lost in some of the Pacific Rift tracks, prepare to get even more lost here, sometimes more than others. They did their best at laying out road flares and motion arrow signs where you need them, but sometimes it gets lost in the smoke and dust clouds and you drive through to find yourself moments from a wall or barrier. The ""Interstate"" tracks were the most confusing. I found myself following the ""road"" too often, rather then knowing when to cut across and there's jersey walls and slim immovable poles all over that can easily be overlooked and slammed into amidst all the texture blending together and coming at you at once. You just need to run the courses in Time Trial a few laps to learn the correct paths, learn what not to hit, what's breakable and what's concreted in place, and to learn all the possible shortcuts of which their are MANY, I'd say at least 3 different ways to go at every turn. A good tip in this motorstorm is to head for the ramps, even if you don't need to get up anywhere, getting air and releasing the accelerator and nitro at the same time on the way back to the ground does wonders for engine cooling now, as well as water which there is plenty of gushing out of the broken water mains and pooling in all the newly created crevices in the streets.
I'd say my favorite region is Skyline. Jumping across skyscrapers and through offices reminds me of my favorite levels from the Twisted Metals, except they never did rooftops this well. It's even more awesome when buildings are just falling left and right, you just feel like OMG WTF am I doing on these rooftops? Craziness (more so cause I usually use Big-Rigs or Monster-Trucks).

-Vehicles-
To travel these routes there are now 13 classes of vehicles to choose from. At first I thought that was way lame that there are only 3 cars for each class (not including DLC) and 2 of each are locked from the start, but now that I've tried to use all the classes I see that that's plenty. The classes are now: Dirt-bikes, ATVs, Super-bikes(Sport bikes), Choppers, Buggies, Rally Cars, Super-Minis(Hatch-backs), Muscle Cars, Super Cars(Exotics), Racing Trucks, Mudpluggers, Big Rigs, and Monster Trucks. While I was bummed most of my favorites from the last two games didn't make it over, I think I can definitely make due with what's here. What's more is you can customize them a little now.
First off, it is NOT like Midnight Club in depth so don't get overexcited about that, but it's very decent for a motorstorm game. They made sure to give you just enough to make sure your car is noticeably different from others online (or offline, you can also use them in Single Race and Time Trial). I was just happy to finally color my vehicle a normal color and get all the vinyls off. The Livery system offers a bunch of 1, 2, and 3 color full-body vinyls. I felt most of them were a little too ""busy"" in their designs, many of them tend to just clutter your car with detail, but there are good simpler ones too, as well as an option to just Remove.
There are enough options unlocked from the start for you to spend some time in the customizer just getting your colors right, and there are seriously a TON of vinyls, stickers, and parts to unlock via online.

-ONLINE-
I find Online to be more fun this time around, because of all you can unlock, and the fact that you can gain points for more than just where you place. That's great for me, since I'm usually happy coming in somewhere around the middle of the grid, so I don't have to kill myself with the stress of having to place high or lose points. Since the whole game is in the Online mode, they have adapted it to not simply take points when you lose, you just don't get as much. They also have increased the amount of time before DNF after the 1st racer crosses the line to 60 seconds rather then 30, so more can actually finish.

Besides your finishing position, you also gain points for Drifting, Air-time, Completing a Race (not rage-quitting) and wrecking opponents by use of the boost nudge (which is probably why people rage-quit). I wasn't too happy that the game RELIES on messing up other racers in order to get ahead, but it only unlocks some parts, new cars will still unlock even if you never wreck people.
To unlock all the, let's say Big-Rigs, you have to compete in races using the Rig that is unlocked, so no more whole packages of cars all at once. Another added feature is betting against other racers, which is why points are called ""(poker) chips"". I'm not a gambler so I haven't used it, but I can say someone almost always bets against me, and I almost always win that bet by the end = free chips for me :)

Apocalypse also introduces a new ""Perks"" system which is sort of like attaching 3 enhancements to all your vehicles. For example the ones I have allow me to:
1.) Reset faster after a crash
2.) Cool down in the air with the accelerator down (becuase I often forget to release it)
3.) Resist getting boost nudged, becuase even though I don't like to be an ass online, plenty of people have no problem running you down, remember it's actually ENCOURAGED to progress faster. I think the thing I'm most disappointed with in Online play is the host still has the option to dis-include certain car classes from a race. So it's a little hard to level up a particular class when it's always left out, and it's also good to practice a little with everything, you never know when a class you never use will end up the only one allowed and your just out of luck there.

I spent my whole first day simply trying to visit all the circuits in via time trial mode, and utilizing the customization options, Just that is a lot to take in. Just for what I did offline without the earth shaking was awesome fun but at the same time there is an off element to the ruined city in offline mode that monument valley also had, but Pacific Rift did not share. At the end of the day, when the adrenaline has run dry, you kind of want to go home. As in you would not want to just hang out in a destroyed ever-collapsing city as it falls into the Pacific, anymore then you would want to hang out in the middle of an arid Arizona desert well exceeding 100-degrees.
However Pacific Rift's Hawaiian paradise environment was beautiful, I could roam the lush jungles, passing water falls and lava-flows forever, alone or with friends. It's like it felt more inviting but at the same time deadly, whereas the same bland broken concrete rubble textures gets a little old after awhile. They did a spectacular job of thinking out how a city would break and making it look right, but you just NEED to be going too fast and be too focused on the epic race to get full enjoyment out of this setting.
However it is you prefer to play there is plenty of replay here, I'd say this should be high on every race fan's list of games to get this year.","Not Better then, Alternative to Pacific Rift, and Equally as Great",1308700800,4,,

Great Features:
1. 3.5 mm headphone jack (not the 2.5 on the standard controller) so you can use your own standard headphones! This is huge for me!
2. Multi-function wheels. I programmed these to take the function of the AB, XY buttons so that I don't have to use my thumbs to use these buttons. Now I am messed up when I get a different controller in my hand. It really helps to not have to ever move your thumbs from the analog sticks.
3. Great look: The woodgrain look is just cool.
4. Great feel: Does not feel at all inferior to the standard controller.
5. Wired: So no batteries needed and it does feel just a split second more responsive.

Cons:
Wired. Really this is the only problem. I'm getting used to it, but the I don't love being connected to my XBox. I wish that this was a wireless controller; but I can't really knock any stars off for this as it is clearly indicated.

Its sleek case (it comes in a variety of colors) slips easily into a backpack or handbag or jacket pocket.  The flip top opens to reveal two screens, an integral part of many games for the platform, and, depending on the game, can be used horizontally, vertically, or flipped for left-handed users.  The controls are accessible and easy to understand.

The game runs the users through a series of math problems, speed reading, mazes, and such that are timed, then recorded in a progress report.  These exercises are excellent for challenging the mind in a culture where we too often sit and let information happen to us.  For this reason, the DS makes an excellent gift for adults who fear losing their memory or reaction time.

All in all, I like the DS, although I find the selection of games still too limited.  It's a sturdy, flexible, pocket game system that, with the right games, is a heckuva lot of fun.

A classic, arcade, on-rails shooter.

I initially didn't own GHOST SQUAD and the only person that I knew that did gave it a bad review and traded it in on something else, so I didn't think very highly of it.  Now that I've got my own copy of the game it's actually pretty cool!  Yes the stages are limited and repetitive, but as you play through the three levels over and over and over you level up...unlocking different paths, different weapons, and different costumes.

It's cool, because the game changes in unexpected ways.  For instance I unlocked a shotgun and while it makes hitting the bad guys easier (because you can be less precise with your aiming) it also makes hitting the hostages easier, so you have to watch the spread of your shots and hit the bad guys while avoiding the hostages sitting right beside them.  Each weapon has it's own damage radius and bullet drop.

There are four-player party modes which are available from the beginning that re-skin everything (including in-game cut-scenes) and generally make fun of itself.  There is also a training mode that allows you to replay branching path options and get a ''sneak peak'' at paths you haven't unlocked yet.

All in all, GHOST SQUAD is a ''short'' repetitive arcade on-rails shooter with tons of replay value.  The leveling-up/unlocking mechanic saves this from being boring, however the lasting appeal may be limited.  This is a game that is definitely most fun with groups.  GHOST SQUAD is an arcade-perfect port of the on-rails shooter with additional console accoutrements.

2014-04-26

This game is an awesome on-rails shooter!  Yes, there are only three missions so initially the game seems really short, but you unlock different paths through the missions!  Sometime last week I unlocked a path that totally bypasses one of my least favorite parts.  That stupid ''defuse the claymores'' part in mission three actually kept me from playing the game as often.  (I just didn't want to mess with those stupid claymores.)  Well now I can go somewhere else and the mission is SO MUCH more fun.  GHOST SQUAD seems short, but I highly recommend that players stick with this game as it gets a lot better as you level up.","Classic, arcade, on-rails shooter",1399507200,2,,

His report:  Much more comfortable than his old ones (which were the SteelSeries v2); lightweight, good stereo effect, good range from bass to treble, clearer sound on TV shows and for listening to music (clearer than the v2), no apparent break-in time.  He is using them with the 2-prong cord on his PC, and while the interchangeable ear cup design is not something he'd use, he at least understands that customers will appreciate this option.

Visually I can see that they're much smaller than the v2.  The v2 now look like an air traffic controller's headset next to these small and discreet ones.

The only drawback is that the packaging was a real nuisance, because the cords were drawn through the egg crate thing and twist-tied together in a funny way, which meant we had to do some actual thinking to work out how to get them out of the package.

To begin with, the graphics are ok but not really amazing. However, the story line and in game videos will really draw you into the thick of things. You'll really want to defend your colleagues, even if you don't think so at first. The gameplay is engrossing, and the controls, while not great, are sufficient.

1. BEST LOCALIZATION OF A JAPANESE GAME EVER: The voice actors are phenomenal, and the fact that each of them was allowed to improvise a bit in order to make the dialogue more natural drags the adaptation from awesome to inspirationally badass. Closed-minded anime fans be damned... Catherine is an awesome game in English.

2. ADDICTING GAMEPLAY: If you sit down and play a bit of the puzzle game in Catherine, you'll stay for the classical remixes. Once you've played more than an hour, you can't stop... it's just that much fun. I mean, you're Troy Baker in his skivvies with a pillow, climbing a staircase of giant blocks. By the time you pull yourself away to work or sleep, you have the Tetris Effect; you know, where everything you see seems like blocks which you can move around and stack. Except this time, your publication's paragraphs must have the words pushed around such that you can climb to the top of the page! (True story.)

3. BOOZE AND SEX: The downtime, when you, you know... AREN'T climbing blocks in your boxers... you're boozing and dealing with relationship issues. What a good way to pass your time! Every so often, you get to respond to text messages in a surprisingly interactive way, which is fun. And if you can't wait to go back to climbing blocks, there's always the bar's arcade game which provides a long series of untimed block-climbing puzzles for your perusal.

If you like being a badass in your underwear, twisty ""WTF"" plots, semi-realistic relationship drama, block-based puzzle games, hard classical remixes, or drinking and going home with good-lookin' chicks voiced by Laura Bailey, you should play Catherine.

first impressions..

1. graphics are very good albeit a little too blueish or something for my taste. can't quite put my finger on it. not the best graphics I have ever seen but pretty close.

2. I find the many buttons to make him do combat, magic, journal, aiming...etc a bit frazzling. maybe I am just used to playing the 1st one on the computer where you just click the mouse when you saw the highlight. I find the aiming a bit harder..for example the bombs, knives, magic...But, am just starting so maybe, after time, my reactions will get more natural due to repetition. Sometimes, making a character do more makes it less appealing..in my opinion. but...combat and whatnot is still fun and challenging.

3. as of yet, he is not shown meditating...only that you ""know"" he did. if this is the case for the whole game, as weird as it sounds, I will miss seeing him mediate near a fire. It was kinda relaxing. I hope to see this later in game but fear I shall not.

4. the journal is not overly user friendly...just my opinion..but, I can live with it. it has it's few good points, but I find myself hitting RB over and over to toggle to things.

5. music so far is gorgeous but I expected that after the 1st game.

6. Personally, there is something about Geralt's looks that I don't like as much as the 1st game. His hair?? his face is just off a bit..like the original's brother kinda thingy...related but not exact same look. But..he is still awesome. Sometimes, what was fantastic before should not be ""improved""...same goes for Triss

7. I like the ""scan with medallion"" effect...that is cool.

Overall, so far, I am pleased. I can say, with all honesty, that I would recommend this game based on past game and what I have experienced already. Of course, the ending of Mass Effect 3 now has me more weary of sticking to that faithfully.

I hope to get more comfortable with the controls over time..but, can say for sure, I find them rather ""loose"" for a lack of a better term. I try to aim and it goes all over the place.

Anyways..that is my take so far. I am sure I will enjoy the game for many many many hours. it is just that kind of series.

big plus...same as 1st game..love the quest manual!

To be continued....

FYI...I installed the game on to the hard drive, as suggested for better graphics and smoother gameplay experience, and I find it is actually true. The graphics seem a bit better. Curious though, that I still have to put disc into tray to play it...ha! oh well...so it goes.

Also, I find the controls are more stable and less jerking if you toggle off the ""auto rotate camera.."" on the options menu. I think that is more for the mouse of a computer (per wording in game manual). Just sayin...

UPDATE:

I find the map quite useful on this game. At first glance it does not look like much but if you zoom in, you can see roads (paths) that lead you very well to where you wish to go. The medallion will also help you to know enemies are close by in enough time to stop and prepare yourself. It turns red. That is quite useful.

I also find the journal and it's updated information as you investigate. It also guides you as to what to do or where to go next so you don't feel like you are going in circles or getting lost.

MY FINAL UPDATE:

I have played enough now to give it my final review. I am extremely pleased and am having a blast. Also, the fact that I can change his hairstyle with a choice of like 5 of them (that is the woman part of me..ha!) once meeting a certain dwarf, I changed my star rating from a 4 to a 5.

I have loved purchasing PDP products for years, and I have to say that they're my first choice when it comes to the ""off brand"" of gaming products. The buttons are not stiff or prone to sticking like the dreaded Mad Catz brand, the controller is very solid (has survived two decent drops to the ground from clumsy wife), and the sticks are very responsive - Perfect for those hours wasted away in Monster Hunter. As an added bonus, the triggers even have the feeling of being somewhat spring-loaded, unlike Nintendo's confusing choice of simply trigger-shaped buttons.

5.0,False,"01 27, 2009",A2OD43W7EGDH97,B000ZKDOV2,John Berger,"I have avoided violent, sandbox games because I don't like the thought of shooting law enforcement (even in games ... yeah, whatever), and I just never understood the desire for people to play ""the bad guy"". Call it my own moral and ethical compass or something.  But I decided to throw caution into the wind and actually buy one of these games.  Considering how popular they are, they must be doing something right.

I was amazed at how much fun and expansive ""Saints Row 2"" is.

When I first started playing it, I walked/drove around for hours just marveling at the attention to detail in the buildings, landscape, and activity that went on around me.  Even sidewalks that you would have zero chance of seeing under normal circumstances, hidden behind derelict buildings, can have small details like gang symbols painted on them.  The attention to detail in Stilwater is just amazing!

I'm the kind of person who has to play a game to the utter completion when possible.  When playing fantasy RPG games like ""Neverwinter Nights"", I hate leaving side-quests unfinished.  I hate having incomplete maps.  If I'm playing a game, I want to experience the whole game.  ""Saints Row 2"" has such a huge amount of side material to play that I anticipate at least 80 hours of gameplay from running around, exploring, and performing side quests, before I consider it to be done to my satisfaction.  Getting 80 hours from any kind of game is utterly unheard of!  I've already played for over 24 hours, having done a large number of side quests and activities, and I'm only at 20% completion!

What really helped me to overcome the ""playing the bad guy"" issue is that Volition loaded the game with just utter silliness.  They clearly made the smart move in removing some of the realism to add humor and goofy playability.  Whether the humor comes from the outrageous commercials on the radio or the sheer toilet humor (pun intended) in spraying sewage all over the place, there is a ton of off-the-wall humor and irreverent activities in this game.  Even being able to just wave ""hello"" to passers by and have them respond adds another bit of over-the-top silliness.  Here you are trying to take over the city, having just ruthlessly killed rival gang members, but wave ""Hi"" to a person walking down the street and they respond like you're the friendliest person on each.  It's one of those stupid, subtle bits of humor that had me chuckling not because it was genuinely funny but because of its absurdity.

I share the frustration with other reviewers that cars, people, or objects have a tendency to disappear once they are out of your view.  There have been many times where a car that is wanted at the chop shop would pass me, and by the time I turn around to try to carjack it it's gone.  Other times I'm just so frustrated with running that I turn around to steal the car in the parking lot that I just ran past.  The car's not there any more.  This happens often and can be incredibly annoying.  This game should be fixed so that there is a certain radius around your character where all items or people stay where they are until they are completely out of that radius.

The only real WTF moment was when I saw that the ""streaking"" game utilized censorship over the character's nether-regions.  Once again, the American need to act Puritanical shows itself.  Blood, violence, swearing, running over people with the car, mowing them down with a machine gun, killing law enforcement -- hey, no problem!  But show a certain part of the body and suddenly it's ""NO, NO, NO!! We can't show that!  Blowing people's heads off is fantastic!  Go for it!  But don't expect us to show a nipple!  We have to censor that!""  { face palm }  Volition, either we're mature enough to handle the whole package or we're not!  Pick one!  Don't treat us like adults and use the ""M"" rating for cover when it comes to violence, then hide in cowardice and treat us like children who need to be shielded when it comes to nudity!

Regardless, I was shocked at how much fun this game is.  The violence  is cartoonish more than anything else; the gameplay can be fast and furious; hidden items and quests abound; there are lots of absurd humorous bits; and the number of side quests and activities can keep you occupied for dozens and dozen of hours.

Buy it.  Once the absurdity of the gameplay and the scope of what you can do in Stilwater kick in, the fun factor takes over and you could end up spending a lot more time with it than you thought.",Far more fun than I thought it would be,1233014400,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",

To me the cost was prohibitive for the games and since you can not use them for other things like work which you can do on a PC. The Wii changed my attitiude. Since my wife asked for a Wii for Christmas I have bought several games and devices to make the overall experience better. I must admit I love playing most of the games myself and some are indeed very physically demanding. I recommend this Wii system to people of all ages and this software runs the gamut of being useful in playing a variety of the games for the Wii. One warning, be sure to clear the area in front of the TV.

The problem isn't the controls strapped to your wrist, it is hitting items on tables with those controls and sending them flying into the TV screen. While bowling with the Wii I launched a TV remote control into my HD Projection TV set and cracked the plexiglass screen. So with the bat, golf club, and tennis racket you run the risk of hitting something into your set. Just be aware of that and clear the area of any hard items. I highly recommend the Wii. Great fun and exercise rolled up into one package. I suggest you shop around as sometimes they are way overpriced because they are not easy to find, however with a little effort you will find them selling for the manufacturer's retail or slightly higher.

I have been playing the Wii since it came out, and it's still going strong.  But for the record, let me point out that you should read this review with the understanding that I am a huge Nintendo fan.  Also, I am a 22 year old Male who's been playing video games since the original NES.

The Wii is truly awesome.  The motion controls, from swinging the remote as a sword to using it as a steering wheel, make for some very exciting experiences.  Although some games don't use this feature very well (sloppy motion to on-screen translation), the ones that apply it properly are gems.  Some examples are Madworld, Mario Party 8, Zelda: Twilight Princess, Mario Kart, and Wii Play.

The pointer is a huge plus.  It reads extremely well on every game I have played that utilizes this feature.  Metroid Prime 3, Super Mario Galaxy, Zelda, Wii Play, and Red Steel are great examples of how good this can work.  Shooters, like Metroid Prime 3, are greatly augmented by being able to point and shoot with such accuracy.  It adds a realistic layer of skill to shooters that I find very immersing.

There are plenty of games that can use the Gamecube controller or Classic controller attachment instead for those that don't like the Wii controller--Guilty Gear XX Accent Core, Super Smash Brothers Brawl, etc.  Virtual Console downloads are awesome, as well as some of the Wii Ware games that have emerged.  Having the opportunity to download great games from the NES, SNES, NeoGeo, Sega, Turbo Grafx, etc. adds some serious value to the Wii, in my opinion.  Backwards compatibility with all GCN games is cool as well.

The Wii has frozen a few times in the middle of a game, but it's very rare.  The overall performance of the Wii is excellent.  It doesn't over heat, the electric power usage is (understandably) less than the other major systems, and its nice compact size is very appealing.

The problem that a lot of people have with this system is the ""lack"" of ""mature"" games.  I will admit that if you are into hard core shooters, the Wii is not the best system (although the Conduit might change that).  RPGs aren't very common either.  However, there are plenty of great games that older gamers can enjoy on the Wii.  For example, Zelda, Metroid Prime 3, Mad World, No More Heroes, Medal of Honor: Heroes, Super Mario Galaxy, Battalion Wars 2, Okami (a PS2 port with Motion Controls added), Resident Evil 4 (what many people consider to be the best version), Excite Truck, and others.  There are also many more coming out in the future.

To summarize my points, the Wii's controller features can be very effective when used properly.  The pointer is very efficient for shooters, the motion controls add plenty of depth, and there are some really great games for the system.  It's not going to be everybody's favorite, but it's definitely mine.",Amazing system,1238544000,3,{'Color:': ' White'},

Nintendo Selects are reprints of classic, beloved games and are supposed to only cost $20. Anything more is a scalper trying to take advantage. 1-star for scalpers, 5-stars for Ocarina of Time 3D. Now, here's a review of OoT3D itself....

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Ocarina-of-Time/dp/B00000DMB3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a>, is truly a special game. It is one of those rare treats in an artistic medium for which the universal praise and superlatives are entirely true no matter what angle you look at it from. Very few would argue against Ocarina of Time's greatness, or its lasting impact on the industry as a whole, and the fact remains that even after all these years since its release, it still reigns supreme as the world record holder for highest rated game in history. To attempt to remake such a classic masterpiece is a very daunting task indeed, but developer Grezzo, under Nintendo's watchful eye, did just that. The question is, is the remake worthy of the original's name? In short, yes, yes it is. This, to me, is the shining example of what remakes should be, but allow me to go into greater detail to explain why I think this.

Full Disclosure: The Legend of Zelda series is my favorite franchise in video games (a hobby I consider my favorite pastime). It is no stretch to say that Ocarina could very well be the greatest video game ever made thus far in the relatively young entertainment medium. The incredibly epic story of good versus evil, the compelling characters, the masterful gameplay, the beautiful art design, the iconic music, the sheer variety and amount of excellent content, the majesty and mystery of exploring the massive (at the time of its release, anyway) world of Hyrule, Ocarina had it all, and honestly, it still does. You could play this today in its original format and despite its age, you'd still get a masterpiece (as evident by its popularity on the Wii Virtual Console). I make no apologies for my belief in these statements, and I stand by them. Obviously, when considering how to rate a remake, you first have to consider the backbone of the package by analyzing the original works being remade. Ocarina 3D has one of the best games ever to work with, so no problems here. Second, you have to consider what work went into the game to qualify it as a ""remake"" AND if it benefits the original work enough to warrant a remake treatment. How does Ocarina of Time 3D fare in that regard?

Back in 1998, Ocarina of Time was groundbreaking in many ways as a 3D adventure game, but one of the most striking examples of this were in its visuals. If you play the original today, you'll obviously notice Ocarina has aged pretty horribly, despite the timeless art design, gameplay, music, story, etc. Graphically, Ocarina needed a facelift, and this 3DS remake does just that masterfully. From character models/animations to structures to textures, literally everything was remade from the ground up visually. Grezzo's goal in remaking the visuals was to finally channel the exact art design that was originally conceived, seen through the original official concept/promotional art for the game. That been said, rather than being the detailed, adult graphic novel style of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twilight-Princess/dp/B0009UBR3A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twilight Princess</a>, OoT3D is more like a vibrant, colorful stylized comic book/anime. Is that bad? By no means! It's more a matter of taste. Personally, I think this game is absolutely gorgeous! The 3DS is essentially a portable Gamecube in terms of graphical capabilities, so imagine that kind of power channeling the original epic concept and promotional art for Ocarina and you have a pretty good idea what you're looking at here. If you don't think the difference between the original and this is much, I dare you to say so after looking at videos and screenshots of them side-by-side. Yes, in terms of visuals, Grezzo nailed it with this remake! To play Ocarina with the visuals it was always intended to have before but couldn't because of hardware limitations is reason enough alone to warrant a purchase, but that's not all Ocarina 3D has going for it visually.

Another visual treatment that this remake got was one that only the 3DS could offer: 3-D (duh). In all honesty, this is one of the better examples of stereoscopic 3-D on the 3DS. I actually found myself playing the game with the 3-D slider all the way up most of the time, and viewed it as an essential aspect to the experience, something I did not expect going into it. That 3-D effect really lent this feeling of organic life to the game, and helped Hyrule truly feel like a living, breathing world. As gimmicky as that all may sound, it's very true in this game's case. Nintendo did a great job making this a showpiece for the 3DS' three-dimensional capabilities. The only problem I ever encountered in this area was image ghosting in places where there was very high contrast, but that's more of a criticism of the 3DS' screen system and not this game.

Koji Kondo's work as the main composer in Ocarina of Time is unrivaled in terms of iconic, brilliant music in a game. To this day, Ocarina's music is required listening for any fan of Nintendo, Zelda, video games, you name it. That been said, they did not rock the boat when handling the soundtrack for this game. The music was remastered, but plays pretty much unaltered in any way from the original (per Kondo's request). It's fun to take in the sound/music design in this game, as the original was pretty groundbreaking in this way. For example, the Hyrule field theme would change in pace and instrumentation depending on circumstances, which is something we take for granted today, but back then it was amazing. It is still impressive today. Grezzo's treatment of the audio was extremely respectful, upgrading and refining without altering, and as a massive fan of Zelda, that is exactly what I wanted.

The controls are as intuitive and satisfying as ever, and in some areas may actually be better than the good ol' N64 ""pitchfork"" set-up, which always worked so well. The lower touchscreen on the 3DS is utilized to great effect, making looking at the map, changing equipment and gear, changing the view to first-person, talking to Navi, using two of four item slots, and playing the Ocarina, all smoother and more accessible. Otherwise, the action buttons are masterfully mapped on the 3DS' button layout, no complaints there. I DID find my hand cramping after extended play due to the button placement for z-targeting and shield usage, but that's more criticism of the slick, compact 3DS itself. This&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/3DS-hand-grip/dp/B004UBSR46/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">3DS hand grip</a>&nbsp;helped *immensely* in that way (and if you have a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/3DS-XL/dp/B008GEH9HO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">3DS XL</a>, then&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-highly-recommend-this-grip/dp/B008XHCLFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I highly recommend this grip</a>). You also have the option to use the 3DS' gyroscopic capabilities to aim things like your bow that feels really good to use, but that often means losing the 3-D effect, so there is a trade-off there.

To summarize, this remake is, in my opinion, the best version of one of the best video games ever made. It makes substantial upgrades to the original in its visuals, 3-D implementation, audio remastering, controls, as well as the inclusion of the Master Quest (a game that plays the same as the original, except that it is mirrored and the temples/dungeons are very different and much harder, as a challenge to Ocarina veterans). The fact that this new portable version of one of the most revered games ever channels the spirit of the original so perfectly while still feeling brand new again is pretty amazing. In my opinion, that is everything a remake should be, and is exponentially better than the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/hideously-lazy-cash-grab-opportunities/dp/B004L4AZ7Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">hideously lazy cash grab opportunities</a>&nbsp;that comprise most remake/rerelease/port efforts, but in all honesty, this isn't really a ""remake."" No, it's more of a respectful refinement. You can tell that the developers were constantly cognizant of the massive shoes of the original, and so refined all that had aged and respectfully left untouched all that makes this game so timeless, and timeless it most certainly is. It is just as good now as it was all those years ago, and is a game that would be worth buying the 3DS for alone. Yes, Ocarina of Time is indeed one of the greatest games ever made, but here's what you maybe didn't expect: Ocarina of Time 3D actually refines and revitalizes this timeless masterpiece.

SOCOM U.S. Navy SEALS is one squad game that not only manages to avoid the common pitfalls of many squad based tactical shooters, but it also blazes new ground in the field raising the bar for everyone else.
The U.S. Navy SEALS are an elite covert ops group that operate under cover in hot spots around the world. This game gives you the SEALS experience as best as it can be represented in the video game medium. Through 12 single player missions you lead a small fire team of elite commandos through such a variety of situations that range from hostage rescues, to demolitions and intelligence gathering. Stealth is more important that firepower. Fire a shot or get spotted by a bad guy and it makes your job that much more difficult. The best weapon is often not to be seen.
The gameplay starts fairly easy during the single player missions and progressively becomes more difficult. Sometimes this can be frustrating. Often you need to repeat the mission several times to accomplish your goal. What really sets the gameplay apart from the other squad shooters has to be the command interface. Squad commmands are laid out in very simple terms for your team. Unlike a game like Ghost Recon, your fireteam can do more than just ""run, hold and shoot"". They can cover an area, advance to another part of the map, deploy grendades, breach a door, clear rooms....all this makes the way you use your fireteams more versatile. What's also unique is the voice command system. Using the USB headset to command your team adds a more immersive feel the the gameplay. Your teamates give you updates and you can recieve intel from HQ through the earpiece. If you don't buy the game with the headset then I highly recomend picking it up afterwards.
The graphics in this game are exceptional. The environments range from desert to arctic. Zipper Interactive has laid out some nice areas to play ""hide and seek"" with the enemy. There's lots of cover and there are lots of interactive elements in the environments. The non player characters are all rendered very niceley. They don't give off the look of being stiff and ""inhuman"" as are the SEALS themselves. All the human characters move convincingly. The game can be played from either the third person or the first person perspective. However third person offers the best view. You can see more of the landscape and you can command your teamates easier.
One of the things you can knock on this game is probably the sound. The weapons and explosions all tend to sound exactly the same. The ambienent sounds of each environment are presented well. Crickets chirp, birds cheep, grass rustles, water splashes when you move through it. There's alot of sound happening here.
There is also a nice extra included. A twenty minute documentary about the real life US Navy SEALS. After playing the game it was very interesting to see the actual team in action and to learn about their training. This may seem like a throw away feature but it's a good educational piece.
Unfortunately I do not own the Network Adaptor so I can not comment on the online component at this time.
This is probably one of the best Playstation 2 games in the system's extensive library. It offers realistic team combat while being very player friendly. Definitley check this game out. You won't be sorry.",The Only Easy Day is Yesterday.....U.S. Navy Seals Motto,1076284800,3,,

Surprisingly combat is easier than in Drake's (new weapons such as the Riot Shield help). I won't call myself an above-average gamer. I almost always start playing in the 'easy' mode and I rarely dare the 'difficult' modes but Among Thieves makes it so easy and it's so much more natural and fluid when compared with Drake's. And, without giving away anything, there's a lot more than combat in this game.

In the easy mode, the hint system will point you in the right direction, most of the time. This is not exactly an open world like Oblivion or Fallout - you go from here to there and you most do A, B, C before you get to do D but it's all so much fun doing it, you often forget about the constraints.

And then, of course, there's the Online modes with voice chats which we haven't had time to try yet. Online supports 5 vs. 5 multiplayer modes and up to 3 players co-op modes.

Oh, and there are trophies, of course. Not to mention that you can record gameplay to show it off later.

PICTURE, MOTION, SOUND

It's a game... it's a movie... :) It's both and they blend together. The color are brighter, the vistas are vaster, the attention to detail is sometimes mind-boggling - rain-drops falling, each one producing circular ripples. Amazing. As for the sound, do surround if you can. 7.1 is well... a blast.

FINAL THOUGHTS

It's a 5-star without hesitation. Just go and get it if you haven't ordered it yet. And if, like me, you are not the best gamer in the world, don't worry. Chances are you'll manage. If you have kids, buy it. They'll love you more.

Jak 2 was made in 2003...The game features new weapons and devices, new playable areas, and a storyline that picks up after the events of The Precursor Legacy. The game's plot was noted for being much darker than its predecessor's. As in the previous game, the player takes on the dual role of recurring protagonists Jak and Daxter. There are also a new array of characters such as Torn, Erol, Krew, Kor, Ashelin, and Sig, as well as some returning ones, such as Samos and Keira. Jak II is both a sequel and prequel to the first game. This time the game is Rated T.This game get's a 5/5.

Jak 3 was made in 2004. The game opens with Jak being banished to the Wasteland desert for life by Count Veger for supposed ""crimes"" against the people of Haven City. As he (along with Daxter and Pecker, who decided to join him) begins to succumb to the heat of the desert, a flashback shows Haven being under a mass attack by Metal Heads. Contrary to Torn's theory in the previous game, the destruction of the Metal Head Leader did not wipe out all the Metal Heads. Also, the Krimson Guard's special force of ""K.G. Robots"" went rogue and began attacking Haven citizens, leaving the city divided into three parts. The Palace is then destroyed by an unknown force. As Jak, Daxter, and Pecker lose consciousness, they are rescued by a group of desert-dwellers, who take them back to Spargus City.

5.0,True,"08 9, 2014",A2SJ9PZMSU7AF0,B00E44EZYA,RagingStormX,"The final release of Street Fighter 4. For those who have not purchased previous versions, let it be known this is a great buy. You get all DLC and all characters from previous versions, totaling to 44 fighters. The gameplay has been changed from previous versions with the introduction of game changing mechanics. This includes:

Red focus:

This new focus absorbs a infinite amount of hits but costs meter, this leads to new ways to counter certain multi hit moves and get a big punish. The second change with this new focus is that if used in any combo it nets you a crumple for extended combos. This leads to many new combo opportunites and gives you more ways to land certain match specific ultras that are hard to land or used to prevent opponent from doing certain things (i.e. Breathless, Abare Tosanami, Rolling Thunder), compared to easier to land ultras (Souless, Corkscrew Blow, Seichusen Godanzuki).

W Ultra:

This allows you to have access to both ultras (or four if you play Gen) at the cost of doing 75% of normal damage (60% for grapplers). This allows more opportunities to land damage either in combos or have utility. Some character benefit heavily from this, example makoto can combo after U2 so even with reduced damage it's good plus the utility, and ultra 1 does good damage (even more so if you super first).

Delayed wake up:

Same as CvS2 tactical recovery, this cause your character to get up 11 frames later. This helps escape unblockables and meaty jump ins, safe jump, and many other vortex or set ups. This helps many characters greatly, as previously certain vortexs (Hi Akuma) left you at a guessing game with no options to counter (generally speaking).

The core of Street Fighter is in this game with advanced mechanics, but this game is easily accessible, many people have picked this game up and learned to play quickly. For people looking to get into fighting games or SF in general, this is the game for you.

USF4 also adds in 4 SFxT characters (Rolento, Poison, Hugo, and Elena) as well as newcomer Decapre, who is a blast to play. The characters add more diversity to the roster and each character feels unique. Hugo is a huge target, has high health, and slow, but any combo does 30-45%, Hugo brings the pain. Poison has decent zoning, good upclose game, along with plenty of links and combos that look pretty and are fun. Rolento hops around away and is extremely mobile for confusing pressure or run away, with some decent combos and nice ultras. Elena I'm not too familiar with yet, but has good reach and combos. Finally you have Decapre, with plenty of combos, pressure, and great ultras. Her normals are very good thanks to Cammy, and her c.mk to lp hands is safe vs most the cast.

Overall this is a great purchase and highly recommended to any fighting game vet or newcomer.

The dialouge is beautifully written and seems to be genuine Old English scripting.  The musicis kinda bad though.  I really didn't care for it as it sounded more like etheral background music with no real melody line, just chording.  The weapon and armor design is a nice touch too.  You can make your own weapons and armor by combining blades and armor pieces to form stronger (or in many cases weaker) weapons.  This coupled with a simple Risk system and battles become a lot of fun to try to master.  This comes even more into play with bosses.  The bosses in this game are very difficult, but their difficulty can be slashed if you have the right weapon to use against it.  The game plays very much like the game Brandish (for those with SNES).  You are Ashley Riot and arein a giant maze-like area and you hack and slash your way after the evil Sydney who has kidnapped the Duke's son.

5.0,False,"08 24, 2007",A7N25CV3DT7VU,B000NVKZ06,Angela Dyche,"I've been waiting for this game since I first read a preview on it in one of the spring issues of Nintendo Power. I love Harvest moon games(even though I'm relatively new to them: my first Harvest Moon games were Friends of Mineral Town for the gba, and Harvest Moon: Ds) and this one incorporated dungeon crawling and combat in addition to the tried-and-true harvest moon staples of wooing a wife, farming, fishing and mining.

The first thing that struck me was how beautiful this game was visually. My husband put it best when he compared the games sprites and graphics to the Lost in Blue games for the ds; it almost looks like the games all use the same gorgeous 3-d engine!

I never liked your hp-type gauges in the harvest moon game. You had to carefully watch your character for cues that you were working too hard(if he gasps for air, face turns blue or falls down, you're getting low on stamina or fatigue. Much, much later in the games you often got an object that let you see a numeric value of your stamina and fatigue gauges..if you used up all your stamina, you started on your fatigue gauge. Use them both up, and you faint, and spend the next day in a bed at the doctor's and miss a full day of work!

Not so in Rune Factory. Here, you have a clearly defined HP(Hit Points) and RP(Rune Points) gauge..you use rune points for everything from planting seeds, to using your watering can to swinging your sword. When you empty that out, you start on your hp..use both up and you faint and spend the next day at the doctor's. Your rp is always 100 points, but your hp goes up with each level your character gains. You gain levels when you fight monsters, but all skill points when you do farming things like water your plants or till the soil. When your skill points go up, you use less rp on that task.

In the previous harvest moon games, I always felt the game rushed you, and you barely had enough time to tend to your crops, talk to people or fish. In this game, the pace is a lot more laid back, and I often find I have free time at the end of the day.
The combat feels a little like Zelda: Adventure or Sword of Mana or Zelda: Four Swords. You press a button to swing in real-time and your character swings his sword. It feels kinda weird, like a live-action rpg at first, but it doesn't take long to get used to the game.
I love how linked the games are to both farming and combat. You can't have one without the other. You must till and plant certain fields either in your farm or the cave(dungeon) you are in to gain the pass to the next cave. You must kill all the monster-spawning machines to get to the boss of a cave, and to do that, you must often make use of Rune Factories.

Creating Rune Factories is an essential part of cave exploration and beating the boss.  Clean up the patches of earth inside the caves and plant crops. Spend a little time each day to go back to the cave to water them. When the plants are ready to be harvested, there will be a little blue sparkly above each 3x3 plot. When you pick them up, they restore rune points(which are so easy to run out of by swinging your sword to kill enemies, mining or gardening in caves.) As long as you don't harvest the crops, these ""rune factories"" will continue to make rune-point regenerating sparklies. And since you planted your crops in the caves(and each one has a specific ""season"" attributed to it) you don't have to worry about them wilting or dying in stormy weather. You can continue to use these until you beat the boss and finish with the cave. (I have rune factories in a bunch of caves I have ""finished"". Now, whenever I need rune points, I simply slip into the old caves and pick them up then continue with my day.)

You can capture monsters in this game to help you fight in caves with you, water or harvest your crops. Also, only by taming certain monsters can you obtain eggs, milk, wool and honey. You can't breed monsters or incubate eggs; to get more of a specific monster, simply go back into the dungeon you found it and tame another.

The sound is amazing in this game. You have real music when you first turn it on, though I have yet to figure out what the heck they are singing. Each season has it's own song, and even the caves have their own unique music. The music also changes depending on the time of day (when it's 6pm or later, you hear crickets chirping and an owl hooting)

There's lots to do in this game, and after you finish the ""main game"" (complete all caves and bosses and fish the story-line) you can do the next part, which is to woo a wife. However, like most Harvest Moon games, Rune Factory is entirely open-ended. You can fully ignore the caves and fighting aspect if all you want to do is make friends with everyone, farm and fish and woo a wife.  However, i think everyone should try this game, BOTH aspects of it before trying to decide which part is their favorite.

I'm not going to bother rating this game, as I, along with a few other here think people should read a review and make up their own minds. If you like Harvest moon, this might just be the definitive version(next to Friends of Mineral Town) for you. If you hated the farming/dating sim games, stay far, far away from this game.

I think this game is probably among the best ""pseudo-rpg's"" out there, and everyone should at least give it a try.

-Good force feedback
-Nice PaddleShifters
-Nice Stick Shifter
-Nice feel in the hands wheel material is good, easy to grip doesnt make your hands sweaty
-Peddles are nice, BUT I wish they were spaced a bit more, or had some way to adjust the spacing.

Works great, except with Need for Speed Most Wanted 2012 (the games fault really) you can get it to work with NFSMW2012 but its a bit of a pain sometimes and the game forgets the settings often enough to piss you off.

So-far best games I played with it Need for speed shift 2, and F12013 lots of fun and great support for it (although I have not yet been able to figure out how to get the stick shifter to work for F12013, not really a big deal since paddles work great, just would add to the nostalgia while using older model F1 Cars in the game ;p and I find the stickshifter to be a bit more challenging than simply shifting with the paddles ^^ (more fun too).",Fun as hell,1398297600,,,

Blood Stone has a 3rd person view that I don't like as much, and the graphics aren't that good as QS. Golden Eye has graphics that aren't as good either and the controls seem a bit weird in multiplayer. QS has the best game-modes, my favorite is Bond Evasion. After playing many new sucky games with terrible game-play and controls, like Gears of War, and even Duke Nukem, I thought I'd give my favorite old games good reviews. Since this game is so old it's hard to find people to play online with, but there are still some, maybe more than Golden Eye.

This is the best game so far for the 3ds, in my opinion with the many bew features that it has. This game, Super Mario 3d Land and Pokemon Y were the first 3 games that I bought when I finally got my 3ds. The only thing that I didn't really like was the absence of the VS option. Sometimes I just want to race with the 150 cc speed but normal difficulty but after doing the 150 cc cups, it felt like the difficulty was not challenging at all. Maybe it was because trying to complete the 150 cc cups on Mario Kart Wii kicked my butt so bad my skills impro ed or something like that because I finished in 1st place in all the races and I'm not trying to brag.

We bought this charger at a Black Friday sale and the Sony charger at another, and I ended up throwing the Sony charger out in favor of another one of these!

The big advantage with the Nyko charger is that it has an attachment that fits into the controller's USB port that has charging contacts on the end. This enables you to simply set the controllers on the charger, then effortlessly lift off when you're ready to play again.

The design is simple, elegant and brilliant.

By contrast, the Sony charger not only makes you plug directly into the USB port (which is a relative hassle), but it has parts that pop out when you try to detach the controller and it took my kids about two weeks to lose one and make 1/2 the charger worthless.

I digress.

Not only do I like the fact that you can have 7 characters in battle compared to the standard 4 from previous installments minus Till the End of Time, but you can visibly see them travel with you. It's small touches like that which really make a good impression on me. The characters so far are great. The voice acting is good. The animation is fantastic and the graphics are as I would expect. The battles are fun and diverse and the role system is pretty unique. There are  small gripes about it though like the camera issue people have been having but don't listen to those kinds of reviews since people think having bad camera angles will result in a bad game. It's not even that big of an issue since I learned to deal with it almost immediately. I also love the fact that Tri-Ace brought back some old BGMs from Till the End of Time.

Being disabled with limited use of my hands I have special devices for typing and hitting the keys fairly hard gives me the needed feedback so I know I'm not missing letters.

This keyboard is very compact almost 2 inches shorter than my G710 yet it's very sturdy and not very heavy making it easy for me to move it around. Since it's smaller I don't have to reach far to type quickly and accurately. The backlit keys make it easy to sort out which keys are which. Don't get me wrong I do play a lot of games and in doing so I'm always remapping the controls for the games I do play. I noticed that with the keys being more compact someone with smaller hands will find it easy to use be it for regular use or gaming.

It does come with a disc that has the drivers on it and a small manual that explains how to adjust the backlit colors brightness or even change them if you wish. I haven't programed for any of my games yet but it looks like it won't be very difficult to do. The board is also pleasing to look at so it does not look out of place on ones desk.

It was frustrating at first because we'd just finished Lego Marvel Superheroes and loved being able to fly. Plus, there was a bit of a learning curve, because it's hard to remember which dwarf has which skill (who has the shovel? who can shoot targets?). But once we got rolling, we really enjoyed it.

My favorite things:
1. The side quests had a nice variety of puzzles, obstacle courses, and ""defeat the boss"" challenges. Several were tricky but none were impossible. Plus, it was easy to keep track of which ones we'd done vs. which ones we needed to finish. This was the first Lego game we were able to finish 100%.
2. As with all of the Lego games, you collect bricks for completing certain tasks (completing a level, collecting a certain number of studs, etc.) but in this case you actually need them because they're used to forge Mithril treasure items
3. The Lego build mini-games
4. The level of detail is amazing. I didn't realize just how awesome it was until I'd played the game and then saw the movie a second time. Whenever you travel to Bree on the map, it's dark and rainy. Why? Because in the movie, the scene set in Bree is at night and in the rain. And in Bree, one of the side quests is to get 50 carrots for one of the villagers, because in the movie, Peter Jackson is seen (briefly) eating a carrot.

Tony Angelo is a cab driver that is lonely and down on his luck in the 1930's.  After picking up some mobsters in his taxi one day he is thrown into a chaotic, wild ride that takes him to the top rankings of a Mafia family where betrayal, murder, life changing plot twists and turns are a part of every day life.
The main characters are memorable and wonderfully voice acted. The facial textures and animation are probably the best of the current PC games, and the graphics engine, while a system hog, are so good it makes it feel like real cinema.
The action scenes are challenging but fun to play over and over until you accomplish your goal.  And every little detail boasts 1930's gangster era novelty, from the brick roads and trolleys, to the clothes, hairstyles, weapons and cars.
Mafia is probably the most stylish and immersive game since No One Lives Forever and Deus Ex.  The third person controls work suprisingly well in the gun fight scenes, and there are plenty of different missions to keep it interesting and have you longing to find out what happens next.
There is too much about this game to go into more detail here, but I couldn't recommend a game more highly.  It's a ""grown up's"" game unlike GTA3, which has similar mechanics, but in my opinion doesn't come close to the over-all production value and entertainment that Mafia offers.
If you have a decent computer system and video card, and you only bought one PC game this year, Mafia should be it!

People had LAN parties before high speed internet service was the norm. Pretty much everyone has high speed these days so again, the LAN gripe is irrelevant.

Now, for a realistic review of this game... it's awesome. The game looks fantastic and the game play is even better that the original (which is hard to do).
The only realistic downside is that you can only play the Terran campaign. Obviously the other two faction campaigns will come later on and at the full add-on price (which sucks).  However, seriously people, with all of that said this game IS awesome.

Follow Up:
After continuing to read negative reviews of this game I've come to the conclusion that (apparently) the majority of the people who bought this game are a bunch of whiney little babies who probably still live with their parents even though they are now in their 30's.

Point 1 - LAN is irrelevant. 99% of the people playing this game also play WoW (you know you do). How is WoW played? Oh right, over the internet. LAN is not an option for this either so stop crying about it.

Point 2 - The graphics ARE great. If you don't think so you ARE wrong. If it doesn't look good on your machine you're doing something wrong or you need a serious hardware upgrade.

Point 3 - If the entire game as a whole is not good enough for you then your expectations were too high to begin with.  The game is what it is... a significant upgrade of the original with a continuing story line.

Finally, and I do mean finally... the game is great. We all know Starcraft 1 was and still is an awesome game, that's obvious, but with that said SC2 makes the original look like a turd.  These are facts.  You're welcome.",LAN?!  Really people?!,1280880000,7,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The Xbox exclusive games are usually good.  Some, like the Halo series or the Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic series are overrated, but are nonetheless good games.

As for the Xbox's capability to play CDs, DVDs, upload music or go online...I don't know, and I don't care.  I don't use any of these features.  It's a video game console, so I use it for said purpose.

So when they created Vampire: Redemption for the PC I was stoked. Even though that was a great game in itself it just didn't have enought action to please some of us out there. Now when I heard that White Wolf was launching another PC game set in the Vampire World and that it would be set in the Masquerade setting I was a little iffy on the idea of buying it. After seeing some previews though I have to say I was convinced it would be a good game. I had no idea that when I played it, it would turn out to be a great game instead of good. The one great thing of the game was the atmosphere. This game truly made me feel as if I was a vampire in modern day society. From drinking the blood of almost whoever you liked to the dark night clubs, I was totally immersed. This game blows away anything done before even in the movies. The game totally captured the life of a vampire in such vivid detail. Now having the option of choosing to be of a different clan was a plus over the original Vampire game. This meant replayability, which I am big fan of. I played the game as the Ventrue clan, which was fun as heck. I enjoyed the main quest, the overall story was quite fun and the sub quests were a blast. I loved how shooting and fighting required stats and not just mouse clicks. In the end I ended up not using guns much even though I collected everyone I found just to see what each one did. I got really good with the melee weapons and the wide variety of weapons was really fun to play with. I ended up going with the katana and the trench coat. I felt like Morpheus in the matrix just carving up enemy after enemy. The only problem I had with this game was a bug which happened when you tried to leave the Hunter's Cave. But luckily Troika came out with a patch that fixed it and allowed me to finish the game. But I did have a downtime of a couple of weeks and I was unsure if I would ever finish it. I was glad to finish the game. I admit I was expecting a little bit better of an ending, but it was satisying none the least. I tried all the endings and they were all ok, not worth replaying the game just to see the endings. Now replaying the game with a different clan and approaching the game's situations in a different manner is a good enough reason to play the game over. Any RPG fan and maybe even some action fans will enjoy this game.

5.0,False,"01 26, 2010",AADUZL9EYDTVB,B001TORSII,Mike S.,"Did you want better graphics? Did you want a better shooter interface? Well, Bioware delivered...no question.
So Bioware has made a lot of changes to the game (too many to count perhaps), but one things for sure, they created a winner.

NEW COMBAT SYSTEM:

Much more like a first person shooter now; defiantly fun to shoot people and pop the head off of someone. Also doesn't matter as much what abilities you upgrade or what weapons you have; if you can aim then you can kill a bad guy.

NEW UPGRADE SYSTEM:

Can't really decide if I like this or not. There's a part of me that enjoys how much simpler everything has become and how much time I save, but I think I kind of enjoyed the in depth upgrade and weapons in the first game. This opinion may or may not be shared. Regardless, I was a little to overwhelmed by the greatness of this game to care that much.

INTERFACE WITH PREVIOUS GAME:

You'll hear little reminents of things you did in the past and you'll definitely get the feel that you had an impact, but it's not as dramatic I had expected. They hyped it up so much that your last game would have such a big impact on this one, but I haven't seen much to back that up. I was a level 55 in the first game so I got to start a few levels up in this one and they gave me a little extra cash for being rich in ME1, but it wasn't that significant. Guess I just expected a little bit more, but I have to admit that any interface with the previous game must have been hard and it's groundbreaking, so they get my respect.

HACKING/CODE BREAKING: The new system they designed for unlocking items and hacking systems is a lot more fun. Actually feels a little bit challenging and regardless of your level or path you've chosen, you'll be able to do it.

VEHICLE: Good news! There really isn't a vehicle; you'll pick where you want to go and then you'll go there. The vehicle from ME1 felt like a shopping cart with one bad wheel to me and I'm glad to see it's gone.

PLANET EXPLORATION: Pretty cool system they came up with. You'll use a radar device to explore a planets surface and then deploy pods to check for what you're looking for. This is a much improved system from just driving around in my opinion. Be ready to spend a lot of hours looking around. There's an amazing amount of land to cover in the universe. They really worked hard to give you a lot to explore and it shows. Doesn't have that empty pointless feeling that the first ME had when I was checking planets. If they weren't related to the primary objective, every planet felt the same

THE GOOD:

1) Story is great and managed to integrate with the first game to include your actions taken

2) Graphics are on par with competitive titles from this gen; really stunning to just look around at your surroundings

3) Lots of glitches fixed and too many improvements to count; some things they did were almost to small to even notice, but you can feel they're there

THE BAD:

1) New dumbed down RPG elements feel easy to use but a little empty. If you hated the monotony of upgrading too many small aspects and customizing every weapon for proper ammo and best fit then maybe you'll like it. But, I couldn't help but feel that it was a little bit too easy and boring compared to the first game

2) You'll have to do a long mission to gain the loyalty of every one of your 10 squad members; it's kind of cool at first, but it gets a little old. Really? I have to complete a mission to get Garus on my side? Pretty sure I proved my loyalty fighting the Geth and Saren already

3) The new planet scanning system is cool and I'm glad to be rid of the vehicle, but it starts to get really old searching for minerals. After about 4 hours of it I got tired and decided I had enough uprades. Searched about 60 planets and found 6 side missions, so that feels like there's probably a lot out there. I didn't make it to level 30 so I must have missed a lot, but I just got so sick of scanning planets. Not a big complaint though; I don't know how they could have done it better so I was pleased.

OVERVIEW:

GRAPHICS: 10/10
DIALOGUE: 10/10
AUDIO: 10/10
COMBAT SYSTEM: 10/10
UPGRADES: 8/10
STORY: 10/10
INTEGRATION OF PREVIOUS GAME: 7/10

Whether you liked the first ME or you didn't, this game is a winner. I have my share of complaints, but the game is an amazing edition to the trilogy and you can just sense the effort Bioware put into this. Everyone will have complaints, but I've never seen a developer listen to the feedback and put forth this much effort.

Two days ago I would have told you ME1 was almost perfect, but this game has shown be the light and really set the bar.

Thanks Bioware

The original FF3 did not have named characters as the player named them.  Bringing actual characters in for the remake is a nice change and makes the story a little more enjoyable.  Final Fantasy 3 story runs much the same as Final Fantasy 1 did. The player is doing more finding out why the world is the way it is then there is an actual plot.  The idea of a developing story does not come about until FF4.  Where this game really shines is in the game play.  The player has four characters that can be changed into many different class types.  Leaving a seeming limitless possibility for a team setup.  In the original many of the classes became obsolete after a time.

5.0,True,"01 14, 2017",A2NYI1VJZ9WPMX,B003JVF728,James Hartman,"Infinite Warfare just came out, and while that game is great, it lacks what COD had before Ghosts came around. Ghosts started a bland era of COD games- still great shooters but lack the initial passion that we had from COD1 up until BO2. I'm not saying the studios don't work hard on them (their work shows in the fantastic control, great production values and good plots) but they feel soulless now- ""get the next one out! Make it futuristic again!"". Again, they're still great games but you get my point. Going back to Black Ops, it holds up extremely well almost 7 years (holy shoot...) later. Three game modes- Campagin, MP and Zombies, and each is executed in what feels like flawless execution, though this review is going to go over the campaign.

BO's campaign is still the most interesting thing about the game. You play as a Black Ops assassin named Alex Mason through a series of flashbacks during a torture-interrogation by Unknown indivuals. The interrogators are seeking out Mason's apparent knowledge of ""The Numbers"", which Mason cannot remember. You experience the interrogations from Mason's POV, as he's reminded of events leading up to where he is now, and these flashbacks are where the gameplay takes place.

BO has the second best story of the series, after BO2- all of the main characters stand out from each other and are all wicked likable, thanks to the great writing and superb performances by the cast, including Sam Worthington as Mason, Gary Oldman as Reznov(reprising his role from WAW) and James C. Burns as Woods. Even Ice Cube does a good job as Bowman.

As with every COD, the missions are loaded with cinematic explosive set pieces. The series has been called the Micheal Bay of video games and that's not wrong- explosions at every corner, constant gunfire and the most impossible narrow escapes. The action is balanced and well paced thanks to the cutscenes and a few quieter stealthy sections. There are some gameplay variations as you get two helicopter sections, a boat section and a short RTS style section in one mission, but most of the the time will be spent on the ground with guns in hand. Plus it's a globe trotting adventure- you'll be going from Cube to a Russian labor camp to Vietnam to the rooftops of Kowloon to Soviet Missle silos etc. Each location looks amazing and the level design stays interesting throughout. The shooting action can get mind numbing a few times but thankfully the many cutscenes, above mentioned stealth and vehicle sections as well as the varied and great level design keeps the game from getting boring.

You have a large variety of weapons from the usual AK47 and M16 to the lesser used FAL and PM63. Each gun looks and sounds fantastic plus the shooting action itself is very satisfying. The gore and violence isn't as brutal as WAW but it's still a really violent game, especially during the Vietnam missions. The soundtrack also adds a lot to the game, including a few hit songs of the time as well as good original soundtrack as the background to your gameplay.

My complaints are basically the same I have with all COD games- unskippable in game cutscenes. The interrogation scenes were done with the game engine, and sometimes skipping them doesn't work. You can always skip the pre rendered video cutscenes but before and after a mission starts, you'll get first person dialogue and actions to start off the level before you get control. Sure when you first play you'll want to see them, but when you're replaying the missions for fun or on different difficulties it's annoying having to sit there and watch. They're super well motion captured and choreographed but being forced to view them even after beating the game is annoying. My other complaint is, as mentioned above, it can get mind numbing at times. I mean that may have been the intent, but it can take you out of the game for a sec. My last complaint is the main villain, who is pretty bland and underdeveloped. He's a stereotypical rogue Russian general from countless 80s action thrillers. He's said to be a horrible person, and is said to have powerful influence but when he's on screen he doesn't really do anything memorable to live up to his title as main villain. He does horrible stuff but he seems more evil off screen. Thankfully this was fixed in BO2, which definitely has the best villain of the series.

Overall, this is still one of the best of the series after all these years. Zombies is wicked fun and the multiplayer is great, giving the game what feels like endless replay value, but the single player is what the game is most well known for. Great gameplay, graphics, performances, story, level design and variety. BO2 did improve and is the better single player experience, but BO1 still set the groundwork for it. If you just want a great single player FPS experience, get this game. If you want great multiplayer and a game full of varied game modes and tons of replayability, et this game.",Still one of the best of the series!,1484352000,2,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC Download'}",

5.0,False,"04 3, 2010",A36K8DLXYRUMBR,B00104KJ4M,Amber M. Anderson,"This was one of the first games I bought for the Wii because I liked Indiana Jones.  And I didn't regret it!  First, I love the lego games because they are generally really well executed and cute and full of beautifully rendered lego scenery.  Plus they are easy and entertaining to play so you feel engaged and challenged without being frustrated or failing to progress.

In comparison to the other Lego games, this one was actually one of the more challenging, but also probably the most entertaining.  It doesn't have much in the way of vehicle levels, but most of the tasks it has you complete make sense in context of the game, and it does a GREAT job of bringing in the Indiana Jones story line...you recognize things over and over from the movies.  Lots of varied game play and characters.  The cut scenes done in lego form were cute and hilarious and all the lego things (like Indy being afraid of snakes, fighting the strong man at the plane in the Raiders of the Lost Ark, and doing the challenges in the Temple of the Holy Grail) were all very well done in a way that translated well to both the movie theme and the lego universe created around it.

Compared to the other games, this one also has the best most detailed scenery.  Sorry...but Lego Batman was just dreary.

The wii controls are nice too...I think the whip translates well to the movements of the controller and the nunchuck is a very natural way to guide the character when the right hand is busy fighting.

My only complaint in comparing it against other games is that the bonuses seem much more difficult to get.  Other lego games (Batman/Star Wars) use red bricks.  This game requires you to get a letter and mail it which increases the difficulty.  Plus a lot more of the letters and mail boxes just seem much harder to get to.  On the other hand, the bonuses almost take away from the games if you get them too early since they let you cheat like crazy, so maybe its just as well that these are hard to get to.

As for the Indy part...what's not to love?  This game captures it very well.  (Although I can't really say the same for the new Lego Indiana Jones, though granted I made the mistake of buying that one for the DS).

5.0,True,"05 28, 2009",A11L1MD4AIYKB4,B00136MBHA,Nona,"Square-Enix has created a truly novel game with this title for the Nintendo DS.  The core of a game is an action RPG, where you fight monsters using both the stylus and keypad, while improving your characters' statistics.  However, there are so many innovative new features in this game that make it unlike any other game I've played.

The combat system is incredibly unique.  You control two characters, one on each screen, and fight simultaneously with them, using the stylus to control the action on the bottom screen and the keypad to control the action on the top screen.  While this sounds complicated (it is, especially when you start out), the game features fully adjustable difficulty, which lets you fine-tune the difficulty to a level you find enjoyable.  On the easiest setting, the game is quite easy, even for novice DS players, but is very challenging at the highest difficulty settings.  The touch-screen lets you attack by using the stylus in various ways on the screen.  Some attacks require you to tap monsters, while others have you draw rudimentary figures on screen.  Some attacks even make use of the DS microphone!

The art style is reminiscent of Square-Enix's popular series Kingdom Hearts, although the characters and story is completely new.  If you're not into anime, the art might turn you off, though I don't particularly care for anime and I thought the art style was fine.  The music is a rather strange mix of jpop and techno, but is actually quite enjoyable.  The story is really odd but compelling, and kept me guessing right until the end.  Interestingly enough, the game takes place in a slightly modified version of the Shibuya district of Tokyo, with many prominent real-life landmarks only slightly modified in the game.

The RPG aspects of the game are really well handled.  There is a good degree of customization with respect to your combat abilities as well as your characters, and for people who enjoy maxing our their character's statistics, there's plenty of that in this game as well.  Even though the main story of the game is rather short (most people will probably finish in about 20 or so hours), there is a substantial amount of bonus material that can keep you playing for dozens more hours.

Since this game is really different than any other RPG on the market, there will undoubtedly be some people who find this game off-putting.  In lesser hands, all the strange features could have made this game a disaster, but the design is so strong that everything works well.  If you're interested in a novel experience for the Nintendo DS, look no further than this game.  If you really are unsure about whether or not you want this game, even after reading reviews online, looking at screenshots, and watching videos, see if you can find a friend who has it and test it out.  I know that I had a blast playing this game, and a lot of admiration for the team that created it.","A polished, enjoyable RPG for DS",1243468800,,,

5.0,False,"06 1, 2007",A1POGSPD4HN8Y1,B000CBCVG8,Cap&#039;n Stoob,"If you're a PSP owner, then you're no doubt aware that a lot of PSP games are either rush jobs for a quick buck or poorly-done ports of old PS1 games.  Developers also want to take a system not designed for handling a lot of polygons and lots of analog action and try to make action games for them...so you'll be pleased to discover that Metal Gear Acid 2 is a game that is made for the limitations of the PSP and works WITH the system to give a sound, fun and solid(us?) gaming experience.

First off, the game eschews long, drawn-out dialogue scenes for long, drawn-out text passages.  It seems like bloviating and long-winded proselytizing are trademarks of the MGS line, so adding a fast text skip button gets you into the action quickly.  However, there IS some small snippet here or there of dialogue and it breaks things up a bit.  I'm glad they chose not to go with full motion polygon movies and speech because they used that saved space very wisely.  The game looks..well, gorgeous, with the characters sharp, cel-shaded, loudly-colored and detail all over the place.  The art is classic Konami excellence with none of that messy, brush splatter confusion of Ashley Wood anywhere to be seen.  You get crisp, cool, cartoony Snake and Friends and it looks marvelous.  Anime speed lines, camera cuts and a very decent in-game camera control make this game a treat to play.  Also included is a cardboard version of those Magic Eye puzzles where you get a split screen image and the included cardboard box overlay makes it pseudo-3D (you can also use your eyes, if you're good at those Magic Eye things.)  This is just a little extra and you don't lose anything by leaving it out.  The designers also included a ton of secret cards and the capability to access MGS3 for the PS2 via USB to USB mini cable for photo transfer!  The sounds are generic, as is the music, but it fits and doesn't stomp all over the game.

The game itself doesn't rely on quick reflexes so much as it does planning, some strategy and luck (on card draws).  The game and manual are no real help for newbies and unless you can find someone else to explain it better, you'll be sort of lost through the first few missions as you learn the game's fine points.  I particularly enjoy the turn-based aspect of this game.  As I've grown older, I've lost a lot of the ability to play fast reflex games and the PSP, with its small screen, isn't ideally suited for games where a camera angle is the difference between life and death.  That's just frustrating (see: MGS:Portable Ops for this problem).  This game allows for planning moves and seeing the battlefield; this is something I appreciate.  This game seems more fun and relaxing than worrying that the wall you can't see around has 14 guards to ruin your gametime.

This game is interesting, unique and oddball enough with plenty of flair to attract those not really into fast action games.  However, it's also a good diversion from the usual PSP fare.

5.0,False,"10 9, 2007",A1D3U5OXC1FOFC,B000INV44U,Cris,"Two years ago Nintendo and development studio Next Level Games released Super Mario Strikers (a title that married a very untraditional approach to the sport of soccer with the lovable characters from the Mushroom Kingdom) for GameCube. Nobody had any idea what to expect from the endeavor, but it proved to be surprisingly enjoyable, particularly as a multiplayer affair. As a single-player outing, however, it lacked depth. Gamers could select their team captains, but they couldn't pick their sidekicks. Special moves called megastrikes practically guaranteed goals. And the selection of characters and stadiums seemed as light as the CPU-controlled artificial intelligence. Thankfully, for the official Wii sequel, Mario Strikers Charged, many of these criticisms have been addressed, but Next Level Games hasn't stopped there. It's also spruced up the overall graphical presentation and added a full-blown online mode the first one on Nintendo's new console worth mentioning. Charged still has some shortcomings, and yet it's a definite improvement over its predecessor in every facet and ultimately one of the best multiplayer offerings available for Wii, period.

So many developers have taken the easy route when it comes to creating software for Wii. Just take what worked for GameCube and do it again. These lazy undertakings aren't official ports, but they always have that same air about them -- that they might have started out as GCN or PS2 projects until someone got wind of Wii sales and decided to go with a quick, no-fuss port instead. Wii hasn't even been out a year and we've seen too many of these careless releases to count, so it is incredibly refreshing to behold an effort that looks and plays like it was created specifically for Nintendo's new system and not rushed to it, and for that Next Level Games has earned our respect.
Take, for instance, the game's crisp, detailed and wholly stylized visual presentation, which actually made us wonder if the experience could be duplicated on GameCube; probably not, we think. The title begins with an absolutely stunning pre-rendered intro showcasing characters like Mario and Peach battling it out on the soccer field against Waluigi and Bowser, and not only is the art and choreography beautiful, but there's no artifacting whatsoever, the video couldn't possibly be cleaner. It's a small detail, we know, but it's the first sign that the developer has strived to deliver a completely polished package, and this truth is demonstrated again and again. Slick, intuitive menus revolve around a soccer theme. Compared to the original Strikers, Charged boasts larger environments with crisper, cleaner textures, thoroughly enhanced particle effects, characters who run, jump, kick and perform special moves with very fluid animation, and a host of camera sweeps, screen shakes and environmental effects (wind, lighting, etc.) to add atmosphere to the action. Even the music is catchy, although it's repeated too often. There is the occasional background or stadium texture that looks a little blurrier than we'd like, but for the most part the game looks great and it supports 480p and true 16:9 widescreen (it'll fill your whole screen -- there's no fake stuff here). Everything runs at a pretty solid 30 frames per second with the occasional dip. Obviously, Strikers plays differently from its predecessor, in part because of a brand new controller. The title moves speedily and tightly along at an arcade pace and is responsively controlled with the nunchuk's analog stick. You'll tap the A button to pass to a teammate when on offense and the same will cycle between characters on defense. B trigger will fire off shots or, when held, charge up heavier kicks and megastrikes, the latter of which look superb thanks to some great new in-game animations. You can earn special power-ups, send shells at opponents, drop bombs, etc. By slamming into competitors who don't have the ball or by charging up a kick and releasing at the ideal moment. You'll be able to unleash these specials when needed by tapping the C button. Finally, when held, the Z button enables you to volley passes back and forth to teammates, which can set up some all-pro shots. Novices may never fully explore this function, but for it may change the way dedicated gamers play. These very traditional mechanics come together for a fast-paced and fun soccer romp.
If you haven't yet noticed, there aren't a lot of motion controls in place. This is because the development studio didn't want to force waggle onto players when it wasn't necessary. When gestures are used, however, they are used well. For instance, to perform bit hits, you now motion in any direction as you near an opponent and your character will knock them off their feet. It may sound like a subtle change over the original control scheme, but trust us when we state that it feels much better because there's significantly more ""umph"" to acting out the damaging move. On the other hand, thanks to the pointer functionality of the Wii remote, megastrikes are no longer a cheap means to score goals because now you can actually block them. Megastrikes are more powerful than they've ever been. If charged correctly, you can send up to six soccer balls at the goal, so this new measure is a necessity. If you're quick with the pointer and can move the goalie's hand in front of the oncoming soccer balls, you will regularly stop ones that might've been massive scores. In Charged, you can be leading 6-0 one second and find that the game is tied in the next. It can be intense and frustrating at the same time.

Charged continues its predecessor's rule in that only team captains can perform megastrikes, but that doesn't mean that the sidekicks are still more or less useless. Actually, not only do they come equipped with basic attributes some are slow, others fast, others more powerful, etc. but they can each perform one special maneuver. For instance, Boo is able to send the ball directly into the goal in one quick burst if you have the character positioned in exactly the right spot on the field. The Hammer Bros. can hurl hammers toward the goal, knock out the goalie, and then roll the ball in. These moves are executed by charging with the B trigger, just as you would a megastrike. As a result, sidekicks feel like real contributors now, as opposed to the generic stand-ins of the first game. Since you can also specifically choose the sidekicks you want on your team, too, there's inherently more skill involved in building the perfect soccer all-stars this time around.
What you will eventually notice is that you'll be able to use more skill shots and megastrikes in the single-player mode against easy AI competitors than you will against well-practiced human opponents a disappointment, as far as we're concerned. This is because real-life gamers are relentless, as we've found, and they will stay on you, keep nailing you with big hits and power-ups, and you'll just never have the time to fully charge a kick into a megastrike; and vice-versa, of course. Playing two-dozen matches online, we actually managed to get off only a handful of megastrikes against opponents and our competitors even less that. Perhaps that's why NLG felt compelled to prevent us from being able to skip the admittedlly-fancy megastrike animations, which see characters like Mario hurling themselves into the air before becoming engulfed in flames and eventually kicking the shot these animations can take 10 seconds or more. They look great the first time, or even the first 20 times, but after awhile you'll just want to skip by them and we unfortunately haven't found that option.

Arguably the game's main offering is its Road to the Striker Cup, which enables you to progress through various cups, including Striker, Crystal and Fire. The cups start off ridiculously easy, but eventually become quite challenging, particularly if you start out with a more advanced difficulty. NLG has returned all the classic stadiums from the original game and has added a host of new ones, including Sand Tomb, Thunder Island, the Vice, Lava Pit, the Dump, Galactic Stadium, the Wastelands, Crystal Canyon, Stormship Stadium and the Classroom. The levels are extremely varied and come to life with interactivity for instance, wind that has a bearing on the game and objects that crash onto the fields. The sheer diversity of the levels helps break up the monotony of the cups, which are all too similar. While the difficulty does increase, you will eventually take notice of the repetitive nature of the experience -- maybe that's inherent to any sports game, but it's a consideration nonetheless. What may also be true is that sports games are simply best played by two more or more people, and that, of course, is where Strikers shines.
And it really shines, actually, because it dishes out a robust four-player mode either off or online. Both are great, which surprised us since our experience with Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection is based solely on the rather clumsy and stupid Pokemon Battle Revolution. Strikers is the anti-Pokemon in that it features a very clean, intuitive connection interface and in our experience very little lag, even when playing four players online two per Wii console. The title pulls your system's Miis and saves all your Wi-Fi Connection data to them. When logged into the network you've got the option to battle friends, compete against a randomly selected competitor in a ranked game, look at the leaderboard or evaluate your friend roster.

The megastrikes look great, but after a while you'll just want to skip them and can't. The obvious downer is that, yes, Strikers does use individual friend codes that are completely separate from your Wii system number. Why, we have no idea, since it's not simple or easy in the least. You'll have to call up all your buddies, ask them what their friend codes are, enter them, and they will in turn have to enter yours. With that done, you'll be able to see whenever they are online and you can invite them very quickly to a match. Another real disappointment is that you can't communicate with anybody at all during the online experience. No headset support. No typing via the Wii remote and virtual keyboard. If you want to communicate at all, you better have a phone handy. This is especially unfortunate because in a game like Strikers, as in Smash Bros., half the fun comes with the trash talking that transpires during matches. There are some other minor gripes. You can't set conditions or choose levels in ranked matches -- they are chosen at random. (You can do this against friends, though.) And you will not be able to gain the friend code of someone you play in a ranked match. Only once was lag so unbearable that i felt like i was not even controlling our characters; I actually checked to see if we had mistakenly turned on some unnoticed CPU control option no joke, it was really that bad. But by and large the online experience was excellent, offering no lag whatsoever. When i first got the game, i seemed to be the only ones in America on the network and i could never find anybody to connect with in ranked matches. However, in the days prior to this review, more and more players started to appear online and we found that the process of searching for gamers and eventually connecting to a ranked game usually took no more than 30 seconds and sometimes as few as five. NLG has created a sense of community via online leaderboards. You can log in to see where you rank across the Americas, which is sure to spur competition (sadly, ranked matches cannot be played outside the continent and official Nintendo documentation is very vague and iffy on the subject of whether or not you can play against friends on different continents; we tried and couldn't, but it's allegedly possible, maybe.)

Closing Comments
Mario Strikers Charged is exactly the kind of sequel I was hoping for. It plays similarly to its predecessor, which means that it's got tight control and it moves at a quick, arcade-style pace. But it's also got a lot of mechanical and aesthetic enhancements, from new Wii gesture controls that feel great to truly polished graphics. There's added content. More characters to choose from than ever before. You can select sidekicks, who now come with special moves of their own. There are wealth of new interactive stages. And there are even some supplemental single-player modes. When you're done with Road to the Striker Cup, you can try out the Striker Challenges, which throw you into situations and test you to come out the victor; as you win, you'll unlock cheats that can be used in the offline multiplayer mode.

There are, though, some lingering issues. Despite the added depth, the single-player mode again takes a distant back seat to the multiplayer one, as the CPU-controlled characters just don't match up with human opponents. After awhile, you'll begin to notice the inevitable repetitive wave of matches. And there are also some issues with the online interface -- namely, that you still have to use unintuitive friend codes and that there's no way to communicate with each other while playing.

Despite these criticisms, whether you're playing against friends or in random ranked matches, the online mode is fast and if you've got a good connection lag free, successfully nurturing the high-action nature of the game. And since you can play four-players online Wii Charged truly is one of the best multiplayer experiences that can be found on the system. I've connected every night since I first started playing and this game has me convinced that there is a very bright future for Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.

Those 'above' say you weren't pure in your life and killing Lucifer's generals would make you worthy to enter Heaven and see your long-dead girlfriend.  Simple story, awesome gameplay.  As you battle your way, getting ever closer to Hell's gates you fight horde after horde of Hell's minions
Gameplay:
This is your typical first-person shooter.  Shoot, strafe, and jump your way to victory.  Unique weapons add to the flavor.  I particularily enjoyes the configurations provided by the weapons.  Between primary and secondary fire, you come out with balanced weapons that work up close and devastate from afar.  The addition of ""demon morphing"" adds a kick to the fun.  If you're a fan of Cowboy Bebop, just think of going into a red-eye franzy.
Add in a card system where you can add attributes to your character and you will find yourself a non-stop killing machine.
The save system is very nice, offering a plethora of auto-saves before any large horde.  It also has the standard quick save and manual saves for backup fulfillment.
Graphics:
This game is absolutely stunning.  The level designers are absolute genii.  There are some levels, the last boss battle especially, that literally have you running around just trying to get a glimpse of everything they have constructed.
It is, therefore, very graphic intesive.  I had some slowdowns on my system at 1024x780 and had to lower my resolution to 800x600.  However, with all the settings turned on, the way the game utilizes the anti-aliasing on my FX5200 I was hard pressed to tell the difference in resolutions.
They Pain 3d engine has some stunning physics models to boot.  The ragdoll physics in one of its crowning achievements.  Every enemy and item in the game has a center of gravity, and that center is exactly where you would expect it to be.  There is nothing better than vaulting an enemy into the air with a well placed blast from your shotgun.
The monster models are spectacular and the rendering of the bosses will make your jaw drop.  In a word, they are big.
Sound & Music:
The sound effects are good, both direct and ambient.  Nothing is repeated that needs to be repeated and there was never a time when I wanted to take off my headphones for fear of boring my ears.  The game makes good use of any EAX hardware you might have, adding that extra environmental oomph to your gameplay.
The Music is very good.  I prefer the ambient music, but you will be hard pressed to hear it over the ever persistant battle music. However, my only gripe is that the battle music gets tedious after a bit.  It serves a purpose letting you know monsters are about and for that it's alright.  It's just not my kind of music so it grates on my nerves after a bit.
Overall
Contrary to the caps-lock induced speil of the games many flaws below, all I have to say is if you don't have a good gaming rig, this thing will be a pain.  The only bugs I found had me, at the worst part, restart the level.  The game crashed to desktop once but that was do to me running too many programs in the background.

It was the first in it's time.  The first game to have actual 3-D characters, rather than the suposive 3-D design that ""Doom"" and ""Duke Nukem"" bragged about their choppy, cardboard design.  Now that the movie of ""Resident Evil"" is out, kids and teenagers will be rushing out to buy the RE games.  For an aparent reason, the original RE isn't being sold anymore, rather that it's very, very rare and probably costs around 70 to 80 dollars.  Instead, they're is the Director's Cut. The DC is a odd version of RE that most people will be mistaking by the name.  No, it isn't more gorier, and no, Deleted Scenes not included; seriously.  Originally, the DC version had a much more explicit graphic beginning, with blood and all.  But due to censorship and problems with young kids bying M-Rated games and watching R-Rated movies, the scenes were cut out.  The only real different thing about the Director's Cut is the different costumes availible and items are in different spots. This will leave already RE owners high and dry, while satisfying non-RE game owners.  Anyways, the story.
In RE, a group of Special tactics commandos, known as S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics and Rescue Squad) are dispacthed to a secluted mansion in the middle of a remote forrest.  The mansion once harvested top secret government experiments, lead by a Evil Corporation known as ""Umbrella"".  After the first squad, Bravo Team, was shot down from their helicopter and diseapeared without communication.  The second squad, Alpha Team, was sent to rescue them.  But a few scuffles with unknown creatures, leads their helicopter leaving them in the middle of the forrest.  In panic, the team finds refuge in the mansion. But little does the team know is that their troubles just begun.  You have the choice to either play Chris Redfield, a ex-marine turned SWAT commander, or Jill Valentine, a strong guided commando with the ability to pick lock doors and locks.  Through out the game, you must survive in the mansion. Your enemies are Bio-infested Zombies....that's right, zombies.  The problem; you're running low on ammo.  The story goes together, much like the basis for Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn"" or George Romeo's ""Night of the living Dead"".

The Dpad is super soft and easy on the fingers, but still manages to be tactile and responsive. The face buttons are nice and big for a gamepad, making it ideal for fighting games and pressing buttons simultaneously with just your thumb, or playing claw style. The Dpad can even be rotated up to 20 degrees clockwise to make it easier on claw grip players, and the sensitivity of the diagonals on the DPad can also be adjusted with a flat-head screwdriver or a coin (Though I found the default setting perfect).

This system costs $499 shipped as of writing, and it came with Titanfall which retails for $59.99. The game is a digital code, so to some it matters to be its the preferred option. I am not one to trade back games, and I hate getting up to change disks and what not. I play this and my PS4 on a 70"" Sony KDL 550R, and both machines look about the same I sit about 9-10ft away.

Ok, the system it self is large, and much bigger then the PS4 or PS3, but it fits in my entertainment center very well and blends very well with my receiver. I can see people who are not major gamers liking this option with out making their living room look like a 13 year old runs the house. I really like the sleek boxy look, and its fairly silent, but not dead silent. The system is quieter then the PS4 which at times when playing KillZone gets rather loud due to the cooling. This system requires that the a power brick is used, and unlike the PS4 its not built into the system. So hiding it can be a little bit of a pain, but not impossible with how big the Xbox One is.

Kinect...its a love and hate relation ship. When it works it works like a dream, and you really get used to walking into your house and saying ""X-box On"". Everything turns on and is sitting on the X-box one home screen, and then in the mornings I say xbox watch tv, and it puts the news on while I have my coffee and get ready for the day. However, we are in the process of redoing our floors, and the whole house echoes and the Kinect is having a hard time hearing X-box One. Yeah, it gets frustrating, but I am sure once everything is back to normal so will be Kinect.

Games, Games, Games....see I bought the PS4 not he nothing its the gamers machine. Well BF4 I play on PS4, but its on X1 as well, and having played them side by side I really could not tell the difference in 900p vs 1080p (experts tell me those are the resolutions). However, I am in love with Forza 5, excellent racing game and I am not much of a racer that game is 1080p and looks so amazing. Killer Instinct is a fighting game they offer on a free/paid program. You start the game for free with all options enabled except you get only one character try out with (they rotate characters on a weekly basis), and you can buy characters individually or buy the whole game for $19.99. The gameplay was very refreshing and fun to play, and best part is the training mode. Least, but not last is Titanfall....well where do I begin the game is amazing to say the least. First, I suck at online shooters, and in this game its okay you get to kill dumb AI and still get points lol...so yeah I killed a real person in it there other day was amazing lol. Go to a game site and read proper reviews the game is excellent a a hoot to play with friends. Talking about playing with friends the quality of the game chat is a sharp as using my iPhone its amazing really really good.

So overall I am very happy with this purchase, and it comes with a lot of value something I found lacking in the PS4 (now I know it cots less, but seemed I also got less).

Lego Batman 3! The Lego games are very kid friendly. My daughter started playing them with Lego Star Wars when she was about 11. She's a young adult now and still loves them. They are kid friendly, but with humor and details that will appeal to adult franchise fans. For example this game has a lot of characters and jokes that you'll understand if you're a Batman or comic geek but that might be lost on some kids. Burt Ward and Adam West are both characters in the game, there are characters such as Lobo who is marketed more for adults than kids (originally a parody of Wolverine, he's got his own following now), all sorts of things to unlock. As a long time Dick Grayson fan, I'm tickled by Nightwing variations. Going from Adam West in the 60s, to Lynda Carter's Wonder Woman, the old WW theme song is part of the soundtrack.
If you've been a fan of the Lego licensed games, this plays generally the same way. Collect pieces, build things, role playing and lots of maps. It's really attractive. Lots of details and beautiful backgrounds. The same kind of humor that's in the other games as well.

Final Fantasy VI is perhaps one of my all time favorite final fantasy games in the franchise. If your a fan of FF, you MUST play this game, even if your not, its a great starting point. The game's visuals deliver a very original steampunk look, with an absolutely unprecedented degree of detail in the scenery, surpassed only by the same company's Chrono Trigger the following year. As a classic RPG, it really felt above and beyond the early titles before it regarding visual appeal. Musically, the game is also a delight. In what can be considered composer Nobuo Uematsu's best work of all time, each and every track of the game is a classic, delivering the best of what the system is capable of producing, everyone will tell you this games music sound tracks just ROCK!! Every single character has their own theme, some of which are used elsewhere in the game to signify a connection between the two. For example, Celes theme has major significance to the role she plays in the game. They are such full of nostalgia for many fans who have played it. Just listening to the tracks on youtube, personally for me memories just start flooding my mind of certain events in the game. The same of course can be said for Chrono trigger or Final Fantasy VII, both of these games have sound tracks that no other rpg can even come close to rivaling. My opinion.

The most positive aspect of Final Fantasy VI however is the story. Final Fantasy VI tackles a surprisingly large number of real world issues, the vast majority of which have not been addressed by any RPG before or since, ranging from suicide, political warfare, technology advances, pregnancy, economic downfall, romantic scenarios that are very deep. The degree of sophistication required to even mention these types of deep themes represented in a rpg is exceedingly rare for a game in the mid 90s.

Rather than focusing on a single character and a few side actors, Final Fantasy VI features a playable cast of over a dozen characters, nearly all of whom receive a great deal of development, and none of whom truly receive the lion's share of the focus. Something that I have always found bothersome in a lot of rpgs or anime for that matter, where most of the focus is on one particular character and the story is centered around that character, whereas final fantasy VI kind of has much attention and greater focus on each individual character, although there are some characters that play very little rolls, but they are mostly optional characters and not really considered part of the main cast like Mimic for example.

Not only does ""Final Fantasy VI"" have the biggest cast of playable characters in any Final Fantasy, also one of the best. Almost each character gets a good deal of background story and development, to an extent that one could say that there is no real main character, Locke and Terra could fit the bill as well as others like Celes, Edgar, or Cyan. Its no surprise that they have an almost legendary status among fans by now, and its highly likely that each of them will grow close to you over the time youll actually worry about their well being and their story. Especially the second half of the game gives you an amount of freedom in terms of character development that is rarely seen in any RPG, but I won't spoil it for you, just as I won't spoil any other details about the story for those who haven't played it yet.

Nevertheless, its still one of the greatest stories ever told in any RPG, and the villain of this game, Kefka deserves a special mention for being the most lunatic villain in any RPG, surpassing even Albedo from Xenosaga at least in that regard.

The gameplay is pretty traditional fanfare as most of the classical rpgs from this era, you get the typical Active time based combat system, but if you played this game before I really don't have to go into it that much. The game has not lost any of its appeal at all, and its still one of the best games ever made, an all-time classic and one of the most memorable video game experiences ever.

On the other hand, there's Metal Gear Solid 4. It's like an Anime action film where you have control over the lead character. While a little melodramatic at times, the story is a lot of fun. Importantly, there's no need to have played the previous&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Metal-Gear-games/dp/B001383L36/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Metal Gear games</a>&nbsp;to be able to jump right into this continuing saga (I can say this first-hand as I only started gaming last year).

The difference between MGS4 and other action games that I've played is that you are rewarded for being stealthy and covert. You will go a lot further a lot faster in MGS4 by sneaking past some of your enemies versus blasting your way past. In fact, alerting the enemy to your presence in some areas will lead to certain death.

There are many Weapons to choose from to put down the enemies that you can't just sneak by, in addition to all different kinds of Items that  will help you heal, hide or just take some of the stress of play away (like an adult magazine or an iPod!).

With all of the different weapons and ""stuff"" that can be used, and the stealth action style required throughout the game, I was little nervous before starting play that the controller schematics would be a pain to learn for all the different elements of the game...especially Close Quarters Combat...I'm terrible at hand to hand fighting games. But after the first minutes of the game, I quickly realized that the controls were as user friendly as the easiest game that I've ever played.

There are 4 levels of difficulty to choose from (and I think perhaps a 5th to unlock if you complete the game on the hardest difficulty???), and I can say again first-hand that the easiest difficulty is way too easy. Unless you want almost no challenge whatsoever, I'd recommend starting the game on the second-easiest setting or normal setting if you've got good gaming experience.

You've probably heard it everywhere already...there are some very long cutscenes in this game, but it really adds to the fun; and it's essential if you care about understanding the history of the story going back to MGS1. On the easiest setting I was given the option during every cutscene to skip if I wanted to (which I never did), but I've heard that on some of the other difficulties the option to skip the cutscenes isn't available in your first play-through (I'm not 100% sure about that though).

The graphics are great. The Dolby Digital Surround plays beautifully through a 5.1 or better system.

There's plenty here for gunners, hand to hand fighters, puzzle solvers and people who just love that challenge of finding the right road to the next level. But most of all, there's apx 18 hours of playtime that will have you sneaking around in some of the coolest environments that you've ever seen in a video game.

You can mix things up quite a bit and get a very different feel, not just melee vs shooting, but each one feels fairly different. Tho, I found the 2h swords to have a boring moveset (too many weapons act the same).

There isn't any armour, but clothing customization is quite fun. As well as character building, plus you can customize your accessory (comrade without a thorn) -- speaking of, the thorn makes combat really interesting (grappling hook with special takedown, heal or shield abilities) and once you figure out you can revive people with it, the game is so much easier.

Bosses come in somewhat few flavors, but enough.

There's a three mission part in code 7 (out of 8 code/mission levels) that pissed me off, but it was actually still FUN, plus. . .when I did finally ragequit, I came back the next day and just did it online, took 10 minutes. If you are having trouble, party up. The rest of the time, nah, it can get tough, and usually its a mission that takes 45 minutes and you die at the VERY END OF IT! But yeah, only failed maybe 10 ops the whole game myself, and I kinda suck, so it cant be very hard.

Post-game/group stuff is loads of fun

Looks great on the vita TV btw on my 32"".

The timer on the crafting system is just...irksome and pointless -- just makes the game take longer than it has to.

Want to upgrade your gun? 10-20 minutes you can't use it for...and do that 15 times. Or use people to speed it up but, thats just an unneeded step. They could have kept civilians an interesting mechanic while only providing item/rarity boosts rather than the timer as well.

And playing with other people will definitely show you other ways to fight, other things you didn't think to do, and make the battles feel very different.

There's just enough missions that they don't feel just grindy, even tho they basically just repeat the same few a couple times each. It's way less grindy than say, SAints Row IV's incessant repeated side-games AS missions int he main storyline (which really pissed me off), or of course Diablo, adn the RNG is nowhere near as mind-numbing as any diablo-esque or that beast Destiny either.

It's solid fun, and a workable weapon can basically just be, use the drops, and change your loadout up from time to time for fun, don't worry about much. Use the munititions factories for easy EP to buy colours outfits and compannion equips as you go along, maybe upgrade a favourite weapon if you have one. . .don't worry about crafting a weapon or more than an augment or two before code 8.

And remember -- revive with your thorn, severing is much less useful from code 5 on, learn to friggin dodge, the power attack with some light melee weapons (when running) is a side-step instead of charging attack, the dodge button is useless (run, or thorn away) -- always lock on when using a melee weapon, aim for parts if you want to collect resources, aim for pods if you want to kill it faster, you can bring an enemy down by hacking the legs hard and fast enough but dragdowns and the tier II charge of the binding thorn are good tools to remember, the scatter command will save your life, and play around with melee movesets, melee sustained dps can usually outclass ranged, tho ranged is better for taking off parts later, especially vs severing.

Also, Beatrice will be with you in so many battles, make sure to keep her gear up to date.

5.0,False,"09 11, 2008",A32Y55Z00QI12S,B000E991PC,ARK,"Are you tired of the same old RPGs? Are you looking for a unique story, fantastic characters, and gorgeous graphics? Then is this the game for you!

The story revolves around the Japanese goddess Amaterasu and her goal to defeat the terrifying 8-headed Orochi. She battles using the Celestial Brush -- literally her tail-tip dipped in ink -- with which she ""draws"" attacks. For example, drawing a line through an enemy will cut him in half. As the game progresses, she gains more and more brush techniques to aid her in battle. It's a race against time; she must find all of the old brush techniques in order to save ancient mythical Japan.

The gameplay is heavily reminiscent of Legend of Zelda. One collects skills and items, goes from dungeon to dungeon (many of which are elementally themed), and travels throughout the land destroying evil. However, it becomes much more than that thanks to its story, characters, and graphics.

This game is set in mythological Japan (Nippon); if you're familiar with any Japanese folktales, you will see many of the characters from those stories wandering about! The plot is the best part, however. Unlike the Zelda games, which have a formula -- each area has its major dungeon -- the dungeons of Okami are plot-dependent and have no set formula. This threw me for a loop when I first played it. However, it's also incredibly enjoyable!  You never know what you're going to see next or how the plot is going to turn, and thus, you never know what kind of dungeon you're about to trot into next. It's a wonderful change of pace!

The plot itself is your basic fairytale-esque ""save the world from evil"" romp, but it's a marvelous trip. It's carried by some of the funniest dialogue I've ever seen, and I laughed aloud many, many times -- something a game hasn't done for me in years. It's also heavy on the Japanese culture, which is fascinating in its own right. Because it's so entrenched in Japanese culture, it's not as simple to guess plot points, characters, or character behaviors ahead of time. The lovely result is that many characters and monsters appear as shocks and delights.

Which leads to the characters themselves. Every single character is memorable. That's right: every single one, from the smallest NPC to the final boss. You'll find the womanizing Issun -- a Navi-esque advisor who narrates for you -- an adorable and enjoyable partner in particular.

Another notable quality of this game are the graphics. The art style is so beautiful and unique! Based on a Japanese painting style, every part of the landscape looks as though it has been copied from some ancient Oriental scroll. It was a pleasure to wander through every level -- sometimes, I just stopped to look at the scenery.

Controls are intuitive and the brush works like a charm.

One of its cons, however, is its heavy reliance on walls of text that narrate the story after major plot points. I adore reading, but even this was too much for me. Another con is the final boss, who was downright irritating and too time-consuming, and that some baddies' weaknesses were difficult to figure out. That said, it was very rewarding to finally figure out each villain's weak spot. And yet another con: some areas close off permanently after you venture through them. I know it makes sense for some of these areas to disappear, but if you weren't thorough enough, you'd miss a lot of great loot. Finally: there are inane fishing minigames. Ick. I long for a day when there are no more fishing minigames in any game, ever.

Also, just for parents: this game has mature humor. The very first cutscenes involve Issun sneaking into a goddess's kimono, and double-entendres abound.

Nice added features:

1. Jukebox - You can either stream music from your Windows XP/Vista machine as a media player, or transfer files to the local hard drive (I used a flash drive) and play them in a variety of ways. The PS3 even puts up 1 of 3 different screen savers while playing. In addition you can play MP4 (& now DIVX) video files and picture slideshows.

2. PS3 Store - Using my home wireless network, I am able to access the Sony Playstation Store. On the store, I can purchase and download games and game demos, AND recently purchase/download full length TV episodes and movies.

Negatives:
My biggest complaint is the games. This 40gb model does not play ANY of the PS2 games (like the now equally priced 80gb does). Of the games that are out there, only about 10 are kid oriented.

And he's carrying a game. The game is Spider-man 2 (duh) and just as Spidey is a super-hero so is the game.

To be honest, there is really very little bad with this game. The cityscape is beautiful, the web slinging is top notch and fighting random crimes is excellent.

The web swinging is a bit of a ""get used to it or get off it"" system, because the controls involve pressing R2 to launch a web line, charging a jump during the swing and pressing L2 near the bottom to pick up speed and then releasing X at the bottom of the swing arc.

5.0,False,"11 21, 2007",A3T949XZA2VFE1,B000OLXX86,CSW,"I have been playing Mass effect since 11-16-07 (yeah, I got it early) and I can honestly say that it has been one of the defining gaming moments of my life so far. Mass Effect is simply phenomenal!

The presentation in Mass Effect is quite simply the most amazing I have ever seen in any game. The graphics during exploration or combat are among the top tier of modern games--somewhat better than Gears of War, in my opinion. But during conversations...oh my...they are without compare among video games--not far behind pre-rendered CG films! The music too, is simply beautiful and helps create the strong atmosphere of the game.

The story hooked me right from the beginning and only gets better as it goes along.  A few reviewers have criticized Mass Effect's story of being derivative and unoriginal.  However, that criticism is completely baseless and unwaranted. Of course there are some familiar elements in this game--no game, movie or book can be completely original. Star Wars, for example, is derivative of Japanese bushido, Westerns, earlier Sci-Fi stories, etc. and yet it is one of our most enduring Sci-Fi classics.  Criticizing Mass Effect for having elements in common with other Sci-Fi stories is moronic, since it is those very elements that identify it as a Sci-Fi and not some other genre. A Sci-Fi without any Sci-Fi conventions would not be a Sci-Fi at all. As a life-long fan of Sci-Fi I can honestly say that Mass Effect offers some surprisingly unique twists and perspectives on the tried and true Sci-Fi themes. And more importantly, the story is exceptionally good--truly moving and memorable. In fact, I would go so far as to say it is one of the very best game stories of all time.

I really enjoyed the leveling up and development of my character and party members. The game offers a really nice collection of abilities, weapons, weapon upgrades, and armor. And exploring uncharted worlds in the Mako or on foot is a blast.

The combat is always exciting and offers nearly unlimited ways to combine your party's abilities. It is as exciting as the combat found in Gears of War, but of course offers much more depth. I can only guess that the few reviewers who had complaints about the combat simply don't understand its possibilities. It is dynamic and real-time when you want it to be, but offers surprising depth and strategy as well.

The conversations in Mass Effect blow away anything else seen in an RPG. The A.I. characters in Elder Scrolls 4 are stiff, un-emotive automatons by comparison. The characters in Mass Effect show emotion and intent through gesture and facial expressions. And the lip-syncing, although not perfect, is definitely a step up from anything we have seen in an RPG before. The conversation wheel really does help to keep the conversations flowing and makes them more believable and engaging at the same time. And now, our own character finally expresses him/herself through voiced dialogue, so we can hear the whole conversation, not just half of it.

There are so many great things to say about Mass Effect, I could just go on and on. But it is the way all of these seemingly disparate elements come together that makes Mass Effect truly special. The story, characters, conversations, presentation, combat, and exploration all weave together to form one of the most astonishingly fun and engrossing experiences in the history of gaming. To experience Mass Effect is to experience the pinnacle of interactive entertainment and should be experienced by any and all who wish to see where this medium is going. Truly exciting stuff indeed!",I can honestly say that playing Mass Effect has been one of the defining gaming moments of my life so far.,1195603200,7,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

This game is harder than Ninja Gaiden, Castlevania, and Classic Megaman rolled into one. The thing that makes it so hard is that you can only take 2 hits before you die, and extra armor power ups are rare. I myself just barely beat it, and that's on the 3DS's virtual console, WITH restore points! Level 6 is a nightmare. But after you've cleared the path to the bosses, MAKE SURE YOU GET THE SHIELD OR YOU WILL HAVE TO REPLAY LEVELS 5 AND 6! Over all, a fun game, and it is certainly challenging. The only thing i find disappointing about the game is that the ending is horrible. Once you beat it the first time, the game tells you that the entire game you played was just an illusion created by Satan and you have to  go through it again. The second time, it basically says ""Since you're tough enough to beat the game twice, beat it again!"" and sends you back to the start, AGAIN. But i chalk this up to this being a port from an arcade game. It's relentlessly hard, but you get unlimited continues.","Fun, but the hardest game I've ever played.",1398384000,,,

5.0,False,"03 9, 2016",A3P8ZDHC7XSKSE,B00JUFT3HW,Ravenskya,"I will start by saying that I love and have played all of the Dragon Age games, starting with Origins through all of the DLC.  Also I am a female in the medical field who likes art and screenwriting  ie: Im a player but not your normal video game reviewer.
I have been playing DAI since it came out.  I played through the main campaign twice including all of the DAI:DLC and there is a third campaign that is floating out there for when I have more time.  I also found my way into the Dragon Age Inquisition Multiplayer and have enjoyed that as well.
The main story  So you are an unknown person (elf, human, qunari, or dwarf) who is a Mage, Rogue or Warrior and you start out with no background that you are aware of.  A giant hole is ripped in the sky, a church is blown up, and demons are pouring out of the hole in the sky and several other holes that are poked in the fabric of reality.  Your hand is glowing with a strange magic power that is able to seal the rifts  so you are tasked with finding a way to save the world from the giant hole in the sky, the sneaky bad guy who tore the sky open and unleashed the demons and this crazy dragon friend of his.  On top of that the continuation of the Templar/Mage war is raging on, the Qun is eyeing the area while drooling, Orleais is in political turmoil and Ferelden is still recovering from the Blight (DAO).
So there is a lot to do.
You start out by creating your character.  There are a lot of options and you are able to concoct just about anything you want.  Granted people were upset that there weren't other hair styles, but there were plenty to find something that you could be satisfied with.  Once your toon is concocted you are off to the races, meaning you go through the first set of battles which is where you learn how to use everything and how to engage in battles.  It is very easy to pick up on the combat which was both fun and challenging.  After you get to the first town  you are really into the game.
Visually this game was nice on the PS3, then I bought it for the PS4 and it was WAY better, though I admit that since then I have seen games that have even more stunning graphics.  Movement was good; the fights were visually interesting (though I missed the super bloody finishing moves from DAO).  The story was interesting enough for me to go from beginning to end more than once, but in my opinion was not quite as engaging or immediate as DAO and felt less personal than DA2.  The companions  one of the things that the Dragon Age series is known for, are stellar in this installment.  Even the ones that weren't people I liked  were impressively real.  Each of them had their own story, personality, quirks, needs, desires and felt like real people.  I don't have to love every companion, but I have to believe in them.  These companions and advisors were fascinating to know and to travel with.
For people who had not played the previous Dragon Age Games  they created the dragonagekeep which allows you to import your previous saves, or alter decisions made in the previous games to change the world state of Inquisition.  Also you don't have to have played the previous games to enjoy Inquisition, though it did add to my personal enjoyment.
After my two completions of the game (once as a dual wield rogue and once as a 2H warrior) I decided that I would give the multiplayer a try.  I am SO glad I did.  I don't generally play multiplayer games so its unusual that I even tried this.  Now after having played it for almost a year straight I can officially say that I love it.  The people I have met on the DAI:MP have been friends that I hope to keep for a long time.  The gist of multiplayer is that you pick one of several premade characters and run in groups through a 5 level castle/ruins/chateau killing a hoard of bad guys from one of 5 factions.  Each of your characters can level up to 20 and then promote, giving all of your characters a stat bonus.  There are tons of fun weapons and accessories to acquire along the way and several levels of difficulty to play.  Its a coop game where up to 4 people try to clear the boards and complete the missions together.  I only wish they had continued adding to the multiplayer  more boards, more characters etc.  It makes me sad that it was only supported for a year and then left in the dust.  Many people still play and I never have any trouble filling a group to this day  though I expect many will move on to the new batch of games coming out over the next month.  I still recommend trying it.",Good enough that I still play it over a year later,1457481600,,"{'Edition:': ' Deluxe', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}",

But here's a word of warning on the 80 GB model.  The backwards compatibility is very much reduced from the 60 GB model.  This is because the 80 GB lacks the hardware that previous models use to play PS1 and PS2 games (Emotion Engine).  Now, games from old systems run on emulation software.  While this works with some titles, others don't work right at all.  Sony promises to release patches with future system updates, but they've also said their priority will be with developing PS3 games and not spending time and energy on PS1 and 2.

So if backwards compatibility is a big selling point for you, get the 60 GB model instead (while they're still around...remember they've been discontinued).  Also noteworthy is that hard drives on the 60 GB model are fully upgradable with any HDD drive on the market.

So I began to research all of the gaming mice on the market looking at performance vs gimmicks which right away threw Razer out of the competition. I have never used a Madcatz controller that didn't make me want to shoot itso I completely overlooked anything they had on the market and then I saw this.

So I research this mouse for weeks and weeks and couldn't find a flaw in it and decided to pick it up. at first I was kicking myself in the butt when I found it was made by Madcatz but from the moment I opened the box to the first game I played I was completely in awe. Adjustments were very easy (Would it hurt to include an allan wrench? 100 bucks for a mouse and you can't include a simple tool?)

Everything on this mouse is completely customizable you can adjust the thumb rest up or down, you can extend the palm rest or change the pam rest (the pad works best) you can add a pinky shelf or change the grip. the thumb scroll is completely useless and the profile button is hard to press and is in a very akward location. Performance is the name of the game and that's what this mouse is all about, My CODBO kill ration jumped by leaps and bounds, the aim assist takes some precise adjustment but makes a huge difference.

When you are talking fit, these will adjust to individuals with a larger head as well as individuals with a smaller-sized melon, and they do that without applying pressure. If you are like me, you have probably tried out ones that do that wrong and felt how they press, so it is nice to have a pair doing it correctly. This accents the ear cuffing and gives it a good sound, whereby you can pick up a lot of sounds popping off on a smaller scale like someone trying to snipe you or if you killed someone versus broke a leg.

I've has this set almost two months now and they still work and look  perfect. No problems at all, and well worth the $. These have been played by both of my teen aged boys, and a professional drummer, and they all love them!

I bought these on release day and have not had the slightest regret.

My biggest gripe with the basic drums you get with Rock Band 1 and 2 is that they have no cymbals, and the pads aren't laid out like the real deal. It's not as big of a deal when you play the guitar parts, you expect them to be a cut down version of the real thing. It doesn't matter how much you play the guitar parts, it's not going to help much when it comes to playing a real guitar. The drums are different. If you actually learn the tempos, and get good at your timing, this will transfer to the real thing.

If you use these in practice mode they will output the sounds of a real set of electronic drums, including the bass, snare, toms, and floor tom, as well as the high hat, crash, and ride cymbals. You can play this set in practice mode, and accompany any song you choose to play through your system.

Are they as big a deal in the game itself? Not quite. But it's better to get used to playing on something laid out like a real set and a lot more fun. If you just want to play the game and aren't interested in getting good at drumming they aren't as big of a deal.

These are velocity sensitive and will react with more volume the harder they're hit.

These DO NOT work with the Rock Band 1 set of drums. They do work with all sets of RB2 drums as well as all game systems.

This set is very well constructed and well worth the money. If you like to play the drums on RB and GHWT, and want the extra challenge of playing with cymbals, don't pass up either this three piece kit, or the two piece kit.

For some reason the picture shows the cymbals really close together. If you set them up right they can be positioned like a normal drum and cymbal set. Not the bunched up mess the Madcatz picture shows.

See my photos at the top to get a better understanding of how the clamps work, and also how they can be spaced out better.",Mad Catz Triple Cymbal Kit,1229817600,11,,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41djwUzb2dL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41dwSw8AvAL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41d8RDJ+Z7L._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41V+nThNdhL._SY88.jpg']"

I skipped over all the filler games in between, because they just didn't seem like they had much effort put into them. I was in the mood for another go-round with ol' Spidey, so I finally decided to pick this up from RedBox to try out for a day. The rest is history - beat the whole thing in the past 24 hours (probably spent around 12 hours with everything)...and I'm amazed. This game is incredible fun. If you've played other Spiderman games, then I must warn you - it's different. The feel is just much different than the previous games, but once you play it for awhile you realize that it all works very well and is finely tuned (e.g. Spiderman swinging/playing very differently indoors and outdoors, and perfectly suited for both). Swinging around New York is amazing...you go much further, higher, and faster in this game than any other iteration, but it's welcome. It brings an entirely fresh, new, and exhilerating experience to the table. The story is good, fighting gets fun after awhile after you earn some upgrades, and somehow it managed to not get too terribly repetitive. Then again, I love 'busy work' in games - rescuing people and taking them to hospitals, stopping car chases...it's all part of Spiderman, and they're all very fun. Concerning the featured low review of this game, why would you want likenesses?? This game benefited MUCH more by being separate from the movie characters than it would have by incorporating them. I probably wouldn't have played the game if I would've known emo, prissy, and miserable Andrew Garfield was under the mask. To end this, if you're a Spiderman fan, then get this game.

-game feels best as a platformer, not a fighter
-a technical masterpiece- solid 30fps with zero drops, just a great looking game technically and stylistically
-amazing soundtrack

Bad:
-Controls during fast paced combat work against themselves, can lead to a lot of frustration
-Too much focus on combat (first game had combat, but it felt less frustrating)
-Lunar/Jupiter styles don't add much- I still mostly used normal style
-characters still speak in stunted, dumb sounding fake language (I wish they would just let them speak Japanese)

Gameplay is largely unchanged, though obviously you have a different feel to the weapons since they are primitive in nature (bows, clubs, spears, throwables, etc.). What Primal lacks in weapon diversity (each weapon type has a set of upgrades that make them stronger, more durable, etc.), it makes up for in the beasts you can tame.

Remember the honey badgers from FC4 and how a single one can cause a camp to scatter? You can have one! Ever thought how awesome it would be to have a huge bear to have by your side? Go for it! Hell, some animals you can use as transportation! Ride a bear or a sabertooth into battle? YEP! The selection of different beasts (some are variations on a species, such as a white wolf, striped wolf, etc., each with additional benefits to set them apart) is very impressive, and each brings their own benefits and strengths (and weaknesses, bears aren't very stealthy!)

The story and voice acting could be considered acceptable for most, there is plenty of passion in the spoken lines and the animations are your standard Far Cry fare. Without going into too much, from the 8 or so hours I've played so far, I didn't feel engrossed in the story. It didn't detract from my experience, but I never found myself wanting to see what developed next in the storyline. Have no fear though, the gameplay itself is VERY engaging. From running around the wooded wilderness in the middle of the night, listening for predators sneaking up on you, to planning your strategy to overcome an enemy settlement without alerting the residents; every bit of gameplay has been fun and engaging.",you'll LOVE this.

RF 4 somehow manages to appeal to multiple genres without messing up any one of them. In particular it does a good job of letting the player decide to be more of farmer/socialite or fighter while rewarding those who tackle both. I can't remember much about the plot but I do remember it being interesting--games like these are more about the characters than the plot, so even if you find the plot somewhat elementary you'll likely be satisfied with the charming if not at times two-dimensional characters. RF 4 is all about the power of solidarity/things coming together, so I have to say all the simple aspects of it combine and mesh together to form something far greater, which ties into the theme of the game itself and therefore the overall experience.

5.0,False,"10 27, 2014",A3DBUN9EMFMUV1,B00DC7G1WE,Elias,"It was somewhere between riding a flaming unicorn through the underworld and surfing on a jet through hoards of angels and demons that something hit me. Throughout my entire playthrough of Platinum's much-anticipated ""Bayonetta 2,"" there was not an instance in which I felt the game peaked. Most good modern games have a peak moment, a moment where everything works and the experience is a breathless, exhilarating thrill ride. Everything after that, nothing is quite the same. Yeah, the rest of the game is good and all, but it never reaches the crescendo that one moment managed to hit. It's unreasonable to expect that most games would be good throughout the entire thing, though. After all, barely anything can be entirely good, through-and-through, right?

That's what I thought, anyway. But Hideki Kamiya and company have proved that assumption wrong for the first time in many, many a year. There is no downward spiral in ""Bayonetta 2,"" no definitive ""this is it moment."" That sensation of peaking, of a dramatic climax, begins when the first cutscene appears, and only lets up when the last credit rolls. The whole game is a non-stop thrill ride that constantly trumps itself, what with the ridiculous set pieces, gawdy comedy, flawless controls, fantastic aesthetics... the list goes on. The point is, Nintendo has put out not only put out my top contender for Game of the Year, but perhaps a modern classic as well.

You would be fooled to think that by the plot. Not that it's bad, per se, but like everything else on display here it is a display of utter ridiculousness. Bayonetta's former rival and now bestie Jeanne has her soul dragged to the depths of the underworld, and the titular witch has to go all ""Dante's Inferno"" and rescue her. But there are complications, like a Yugi Motoh wannabe complete with a pyramid necklace and magical cards, and the fact that both demons and angels are now attacking the stylish witch. Within the first few chapters, everything about the narrative goes completely off the rails (if there were any rails to begin with) in the best ways possible, and the player is just supposed to accept the insanity inherent in the narrative and roll with it.

They'd be behooved to do that, because once you accept Kamiya's unique brand of madness, you're in for a real treat. The narrative might not win any awards or be lauded for its emotional resonance, but boy, it sure is a good time. Part dimension-bending epic, part farce, ""Bayonetta 2"" is a game that isn't concerned with consistency of tone or tasteful subject matter. Instead, it's a delightful carnival of unfettered violence and sexuality, reveling in its own farcical nature. It's the antithesis to every grim, brooding game with gritty, gruff white dudes spouting generic tough-guy dialogue. Good-natured and earnest in its attempts to stay ""over-the-top"" at all times, this game is one that I would fervently recommend to anybody looking for one of the most genuine, anti-""big box game"" experiences out there.

A lot of this is due, in part, to Bayonetta herself. Some people have some issues with her characterization and portrayal, and I honestly understand that. There are some points of the game in which she's blatantly sexualized, and a post-credits pole dance sequence is a bit on-the-nose and lacking the fun punch of the dance sequence in the last game. ""Good"" objectification is still objectification, and it should be acknowledged. But do I feel like this is a harmful depiction of a woman? No. Not in a million years. Bayonetta is actually one of the most fiercely independent, in-control leading ladies in gaming, and that sentiment is only backed up by this game. All of the men in the game are forced to play second-fiddle or fill the ""support role"" that women are usually relegated to in modern games, and to me, that's a pretty cool thing. On top of that, here's a woman completely in control of her sexuality, and literally wielding it as a weapon. We live in a society where women are frequently made to feel awful about displaying their sexuality, made to live in fear of expressing themselves. Bayonetta is a fictional character, but I feel portrayals of women like this are important. It can serve to remind smaller-minded men that women can be fierce, in-control, and independent. So while I acknowledge that some aspects of her portrayal can fairly be criticized, I feel that it's good to have female characters like this... just so long as there are other, non-sexualized female characters (Amanda Ripley, Noriko, Rubi Malone, or the modern Lara Croft, for example,) to supplement her.

Onto the gameplay side of things, if you've played the first entry in this series, you know what you're getting into here. It's a combo-heavy action game that punishes players for mindlessly button-mashing. You're forced to learn the intricacies of the combat, get the hang of the ins and outs of how each weapon works, master the ""Witch Time"" dodging mechanic. Timing and precision  are everything, but it never feels too daunting; once you find a few combos that work for you, you'll be able to chain them together ad naseum to slay monsters and rack up some points. Despite this being a sequel, I actually feel like this is the easier game to be introduced to the series with. It's far less punishing than its predecessor, and good deal shorter as well. Also, the difficulty is adjustable at any time, so if you're having trouble, or if you find to be a bit too easy at times, there are options.

What I think struck me most about the gameplay here is the way it feels. Recently, I played the much-lauded ""Shadow of Mordor"" and found it to be a boring, monotonous clone of other, better games. But the most egregious error, I felt, is that I was constantly aware that I was pressing a button. At no point did the barrier between me and the player-character break, and eventually, I gave up in frustration thanks the mindless repetition that punctuated the experience. Not so with ""Bayonetta 2."" Yes, you have to learn button presses and combos, but when you're executing them, you almost forget you're playing a game with a controller. It feels like you have control over Bayonetta's limbs, that you're in the game, dodging and slashing and shooting. Out of all the games I've played since I started gaming over a decade ago, I can count the ones that made me feel this in control on a few fingers. In terms of that illusive feeling of being truly immersed in a game, ""Bayonetta 2"" hits that perfect sweet spot.

The beautiful graphics help with that sensation of being sucked into the game world. I've said this before, and will say it so long as people denounce the Wii U as an underpowered console for kids, but this system is capable of producing some beautiful visuals. Some of the most ""next-gen"" experiences I've had, graphically, have come out of this system, and this is coming from somebody who owns a PS4 and a moderately powerful computer. It's not about fidelity or resolution or pixel count; it's about the imaginative landscapes rendered with bright colors and unique set pieces. ""Bayonetta 2"" is one of the most beautiful games I've ever played, even if it doesn't have 1,293x anti-aliasing or consistently 60 FPS, but because it actually feels like the developer put some thought into. Compare this to the supposedly ""next-gen"" games coming out this month that all look suspiciously like the same grey-and-brown tripe we've been getting served for the past few years. Processing power means absolutely nothing if you can't put it towards anything original and cool-looking, and ""Bayonetta 2"" drives this point home with gusto. It's pretty and imaginative, simply put. Enough said.

That really is enough said about this game, because I can't put into words how astounding it truly is. While playing I flashed back to years ago, when the game industry wasn't as blatantly about cash-grabs and competitor-bashing, and was more focused on unique, quality titles that were significantly different from each other. There's no DLC in ""Bayonetta 2,"" no micro-transactions, no sleazy membership required to play. Every bonus item, every costume, every weapon is all there to be unlocked not by your money, but by your time, patience and skill. It's love letter to the way video games used to be, filled with interesting characters, tons of content, and fun gameplay taking place across numerous imaginative worlds that are unlike anything in real life.

Every moment in ""Bayonetta 2"" is a peak, a high note. In turn, the entire game is a high note for video games, and the only game this year that I feel is worthy of my highest, unreserved praise. It's a must-have, and with the original bundled in, it's a steal.

Pros:
- The gameplay is fantastic
- Beautiful, imaginative scenery
- A love letter to Nintendo and gaming in general
- Bayonetta is a great character
- The soundtrack is a masterpiece
- The best game I've played this year

Cons:
- A certain character's voice acting is dubious
- Bayonetta's sexualization isn't for everyone, and I respect that

5.0,True,"08 17, 2009",AY2GQ7C4JK0OX,B000VJRU44,Nicole,"There are actually two things to review here: the balance board, and the game ""Wii Fit.""  Neither is meant to replace your current exercise regimen.  If you think this game will serve as a replacement for gym equipment, such as an elliptical machine, a treadmill, free weights, etc...turn back now.

The primary purpose of Wii Fit is to introduce you to the balance board.  You can get an idea of the way it works and (potentially) gain an appreciation of it and desire to purchase additional games that utilize it.  The game does have its own merits, however.  It encourages people who are usually couch potatoes to get up and move a little.  The exercises are short, so you can stop if you're tired or if you have something to do.  The exercises are generally easy enough that anyone can perform them, regardless of current fitness level (although it will take a higher level of fitness to master the exercises.)  I worked up a sweat with the two minutes of hula-hooping, and it was fun.  I wish I didn't live alone, because the challenge of beating other people's scores would be fabulous.  The yoga is great for beginners, and gives you immediate feedback as to your posture (which is KEY during yoga.)  The best thing about the game itself is the weight/BMI tracking.  I LIKE that your Mii gets chubby when you enter your weight (if you're overweight), because there's no point in sugar coating it.  It actually looked a little thinner than I expected it to.  I like the goal tool, and I really like that it encourages you not to go overboard with your goal (it warns against attempting to lose more than 1.5 pounds a week.)  The scale appears to be very accurate, and I'm thrilled because my bathroom scale just quit on me (no fat jokes, please.)  My big complaint is the running game.  It suggests you put the Wii remote in your pocket.  When I did this, my Mii ran super-fast, even when I wasn't moving.  It says that you can hold it in your hand, which is what I ended up doing.  That mostly worked, although it would say my pace was perfect, and then say it was uneven, although nothing had changed about my pace.  My other complaints: There's too much time between activities.  The more out of shape you are, the more you might actually like that, because there's time to catch your breath in between, but it's frustrating when you're ready to get to the next task.  This is improved by the favorites section, which contains your top ten most performed activities.  Also, I've never enjoyed when any game has a prolonged ""poor me"" segment after a poor performance.  I don't find it motivating and it's a huge waste of time.  I'd appreciate a way to turn off that function or at least the option to press a button to exit the sequence.

I think the balance board is a genius idea.  There are so many wonderful games that go with this.  Again, this is NOT meant to replace your existing exercise.  Some of the games will be suitable to people already in good shape, but there are a lot of games that more sedentary people can play and enjoy.  Some of these aren't even ""exercise"" games.  Example:  Rayman's Raving Rabbids TV Party.  I didn't get this solely for exercise, but as a way to play entertaining games that get me moving a little more.  Instead of playing a video game with your thumbs, you can play it with your whole body.  I don't expect to get a model's body playing Circus Party, the extra movement is a step in the right direction.  If you're sedentary, it will be easy to get benefits from this, even with only the included software.  If you're more active, you should look into specific games as to whether you will find a benefit from this.  Some titles to look at: Gold's Gym Cardio Workout EA Sports Active, and My Fitness Coach.  There are some promising titles coming out soon, also.

Set-up is quite easy.  Make sure the power button faces AWAY from the Wii console (it seems most people are inclined to position it backwards.)  The only (minor) issue I encountered was that I had purchased a power pack so I wouldn't have to use batteries, but you can't sync the balance board with the Wii with a battery pack in.  I had to round up four AA batteries just long enough to sync it.  Seems like they could have put that button somewhere else...but once it's synchronized, it's a nonissue.

Finally, this SHOULD go without saying, but since I've seen someone post an article on here about this issue I'll say it anyway--it only works if you use it.  Spending $250 on a console and $90 on the balance board will NOT make you healthier.  You actually have to get on it and use it.  Before you purchase this, you have to evaluate if you will actually get off your butt and use it.",Great for what it's meant for,1250467200,3,,
